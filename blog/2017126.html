				<p>IT. IS. SO. WINDY.</p>
				
				<p>I've had to get off and walk despite it being flat</p>
				
				<p>The wind is trying to sap every last tiny drop of physical and mental energy from me.</p>
				
				<p>I have 5 km to Tarifa but I then have another 180 km to go to the flight home. I'm close to collapsing.</p>

				<p>Most people I know are paying attention to gravitational wave news right now. I've just cycled the Atlantic coast of Europe.</p>
				
				<p>My timing couldn't be worse. I'm on day 120.</p>
				
				<p>After more than 11700 km I finally got to the southernmost point of Europe. Please help out @MSF_uk if you can: <a href="https://t.co/KohIMIW8v3"></a></p>
				
				<p>In my fatigue I had to give my passport to the camping person last night. This morning, in the exchange with a new person, I didn't get it.</p>
				
				<p>I only realised now that I need it tonight. This is why I don't like giving ID to camping/hostels. I knew this would happen at some point.</p>
				
				<p>So, tomorrow, I have to go back to the campsite I was in last night. And then come back to here and on to Málaga. This is increasingly hard.</p>
				
				<p>I cannot cope with this.</p>
				
				<p>Really. I do not have the time or energy to fit this all in.</p>
				
				<p>Or money</p>
				
				<p>Last night's campsite are extremely non-proactive in helping. Doesn't help that they don't speak English and I don't speak Spanish. 1/n</p>
				
				<p>The man on the reception in the hostel tonight rang then for me. They left it to him to help me. He suggested a bus. There is no direct bus</p>
				
				<p>And there are only two buses a day from this side (no idea about return). One is at 8am other at 3pm.</p>
				
				<p>I'd have to hope they let me take my bike to be able to get to the campsite from the other end. I wouldn't bet on that given UK bus/coach.</p>
				
				<p>Plus, even if that option works with zero problems it'll likely take all Tuesday.</p>
				
				<p>I suggested a delivery service of some kind. The reception guy kindly tried looking online. It needs a call to a human to check if they can</p>
				
				<p>deliver it to Málaga by Wednesday afternoon. They have no humans available until 10am. Helpful reception man finishes his shift at 8am</p>
				
				<p>The lady who takes over at 8am speaks no English.</p>
				
				<p>I am unlikely to be able to hire a car without my passport (I have my driving licence).</p>
				
				<p>Even with the delivery service I fully expect is that they'd require my passport to pick up my passport. Computer says no style.</p>
				
				<p>If only the campsite could give it to some people in a camper van heading this way tomorrow.</p>
				
				<p>I am utterly utterly exhausted and am out of ideas. I know I can't cycle 360 km in a day and a half. That won't happen.</p>
				
				<p>Is anyone with a vehicle going by El Palmar (south of Concil de La Frontera) tomorrow heading to Algeciras or Málaga? Anyone?</p>
				
				<p>Seriously, I CANNOT cycle an *extra* 200 km. I have cycled 10 (?) days and 1100 km since my last rest day.</p>
				
				<p>Perhaps it is useful to point out I am much more mentally and physically exhausted than you think. Even more than that.</p>
				
				<p>Thanks for all the questions. I am no longer able to provide answers. In dealing with this and questions I haven't had chance to eat.</p>
				
				<p>And am too exhausted to work out how I can eat at 10pm in a place I don't know never mind move to do so.</p>
				
				<p>Also folks, realise I am trying to simultaneously answer questions from several people.</p>
				
				<p>Thanks to the people trying to take the mental load off me.</p>
				
				<p>Solutions need to account for me hardly being able to think (why do you think I left my passport?) and I have a big awkward bicycle.</p>
				
				<p>Buses, trains, planes, taxis, catamarans etc often don't take bikes. Usually best to assume they don't unless they explicitly say they do.</p>
				
				<p>I can't concentrate any more. Night.</p>
				
				<p>Does DHL? How? Incoherent.</p>
