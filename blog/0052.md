Title:	Over the Rockies

On the Friday there was a threat of rain and as it followed through on that threat I decided to go back to the cafe to continue uploading photos. I ended up spending most of the day there enjoying their shakes and sandwiches. By 5.30 pm the rain stopped and I left the cafe to go back to the KOA. At least the wind had stopped.

It rained through the night but the dawn was blue sky and sunshine. This was the right day to cross the Rockies. After a trip to the laundry to dry off some clothes, and a pause for the sun to dry my tent, I went back into town and got another of the delicious high calorie shake at the cafe. Fuelled up I crossed town and joined the I-80 at the last frontage road. 

On the ride into Laramie I'd been wondering where the Rockies were. Why couldn't I see them? All I could see were some small hills. As I left Laramie I realised I'd been slowly climbing across Wyoming and was at 7400 ft above sea level. The highest point of the Rockies on my route was only 1300 ft higher. The little hills I'd seen were the Rockies. I should note that elsewhere the Rockies are much taller and dramatic - I was crossing at a fairly easy point for good reason!

The interstate wound around between the hills. From the plains you'd be forgiven for thinking it must go into a tunnel but it winds upwards over the summit. By "summit" I refer to the highest point on the Lincoln Highway at 8620 ft but it was slightly lower than the original Lincoln Highway. The modern railroad goes a different route. The summit is overlooked by a giant head of Abraham Lincoln made to celebrate the anniversary.

In the visitor centre [I felt I'd earned](https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/472798180405686272) the free "bike Wyoming" sticker given that I'd cycled from the west side of the state all the way to this point nearly at the eastern extreme. The lady at the desk said that if I was heading to Cheyanne I should really go via the nicer WY210 - __Happy Jack Road__. That put me in a quandry. Do I stick to my planned route (which wasn't exactly the same as Stevens anyway) or go this other road. I [put it to the public vote](https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/472801394442133504). By the end of my lunch break Anne Akers, Chris North and my sister had all opted for Happy Jack Road so I went that way.
