				<h2 class="title">Speeding along the lagoon</h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-05T23:59+0100" datetime="2017-10-05T23:59+0100">Thursday 05th Oct 2017 (22:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Dawn is now earlier on clock time so I was able to see what I was doing as I had breakfast. It was still misty outside though and I couldn't leave until the campsite lady opened the gate for me at 9am. As I waited I heard gunshots from beyond the walls of the campsite. The mist and gunshots combined with the deserted, high-walled, compound with barbed wire added to the feeling I was in a post apocalyptic, zombie-infested, world.</p>
				
				<p>On leaving I was wished "bon voyage" in French and I ventured onto the cobbled roads. I suspect someone high up in the Portugeuse government owns shares in a cobblestone company. So many of the roads are cobbled. It looks nice but vibrates my entire body and bike.</p>
				
				<p>On the main road I noticed there were a lot of cyclists out riding.</p>

				<p>My route took me more away from the coast than I'd have liked but the closer road to the coast was the motorway (or probably cobbled paths).</p>
				
				<p>I arrived in Porto around lunchtime. I dodged the people asking tourists for money and met two Dutch people who are sailing from the Netherlands to New Zealand. They have Bromptons with them for exploring the land.</p>

				<p>I cycled 28 kph flat out for an hour from Ovar to make a ferry that it turned out wouldn't take bicycles. There was a local older lady with a bicycle who was clearly even more annoyed than me about that. We had to wait an hour and a half for the next car ferry. My main concern was that it would mean I was cycling in the dark on the other side as the sun would be setting.</p>

				<p>Thanks to an old colleague from Manchester, Val&eacute;rio, for hosting me in Aveiro at short notice. We went to a fish restaurant and had some local cod-based dish which was very tasty. It was almost a whole day's budget but I should sample "the local seafood dishes that the Atlantic coast has to offer" at least once.</p>
