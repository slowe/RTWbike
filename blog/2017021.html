				<p>I met the Dutch couple again at breakfast. Their names were Petra and Anne. They told me my lunch stop yesterday was near to a secret thing for cyclists. I'm not sure what the thing was but they were going to seek it out.</p>

				<p>I was off around 10.15 with shoes that were still disappointingly wet after yesterday despite me putting them in the drying room. My dorm mate from Corsica said he'd look out for me on the road whilst he was driving. I made good progress despite the westerly wind against me. Going around a big bay I met a group of Norwegian cyclists. They were cycling Lofoten.</p>

				<p>Near Lyngv&aelig;r I saw a sea eagle high overhead. Unfortunately it wasn't for getting any lower preferring to view things from afar. My route thankfully took me off the E10 Road onto the 815 which was quieter and on the eastern side of the island so was sheltered from the wind.</p>

				<p>I made it to Leknes just after 2pm after a surprise 110m hill. The cafes were too expensive (standard Norwegian prices) so I went to the Coop and made my own lunch out of town sheltering from the wind in a bus stop. I rode on over a pass down into the westerly wind and around a big fjord to Ramberg. The fjord had lovely sandy beaches but the weather wasn't really suitable to enjoy them. It looked as though the wind was bringing in some better weather. </p>

				<p>I caught up briefly with Victoria and Ewan from a few days ago. They'd seen Sheena and Alistair yesterday too. Shortly afterwards I caught up with Aris and Florence from Greece. They'd cycled from Nordkapp and were heading for the same ferry. Aris had built his own bike so it was "38% longer than most".</p>

				<p>Cycling on to Moskenes I passed drying cod's heads, beautiful mountains and pretty little sea side villages.</p>

				<p>I had to carry on past Moskenes another 4.5km to &Aring; (pronounced like the a in saw). It marks the end of the road in Lofoten. A friendly group of Norwegian motorcyclists took my photo for me.</p>

				<p>I had taken my time today as the plan was to get the 23.45 ferry. That way I don't have to stay anywhere tonight and can be bright and early for a visit to the bike shop in the morning. As I sailed away from Lofoten it gave me one parting gift; a dramatic view of the midnight sun.</p>
