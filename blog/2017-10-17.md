One good option was to cycle to my passport then Cádiz then a train to Málaga. But this morning I can't face the distance in the time.

I'm leaving myself to the option put forward by the receptionist of trying a courier service at 10 am.

If that doesn't pan out my problems will be worse. But I'm so tired.

I shouldn't have mentioned money.

Thanks to @astrofrog for working out the details of some possibilities for me.

I have to wait until 3pm for the English speaking receptionist to return. That doesn't help my anxiety.

But, it means I have time to write postcards. I will have forgotten people or lost addresses. I'm so sorry if you don't get one.

Lots of things need to happen (some in a specific order) in the next 24 hours. I don't know exactly how right now.

Unless you are in the process of helping solve some of the problems (thanks!), it'd be helpful to postpone questions until afterwards.

Offers of being helpful are really kind. I am not telling people off. I just need to streamline interaction to essential stuff until then.

I get anxiety when I've no idea how or if a thing that has to happen is going to happen. Lots of people just asking questions compounds that

I almost had some kind of panic attack in June the day before the triathlon when multiple people simultaneously started asking me questions.

In that case some of those questions were in response to me asking if people could stop asking me questions.

All the people in that case asking the questions were lovely and wished the best for me. There was no intent to give me a panic attack.

I tried to head off my panic attack as it was starting by asking for people to stop. Unfortunately that is then perceived as me being mean.

I literally had to run away and lock myself in a toilet to get the questions to stop. My brain was stuck for an hour or so afterwards.

Again, none of those people wanted that to happen. They are all lovely people.

Things are unravelling.

Cycling back. Lost 6 hours

Update: Txema's (the hostel reception man) plan, of a courier to deliver my passport to Málaga, was foiled by the campsite who had it.

The daytime people working in the campsite refused to give it to the courier. Rather than a €100 taxi, I rode 84 km back to get it.

It was annoying that the courier got refused at 3pm as I had lost 6 hours of cycling time hanging around Algeciras.

But, @astrofrog has been great finding multiple detailed options for me to travel from different places. Thanks Thomas for doing that.

Also, huge thanks to everyone who has given to @MSF_uk recently. [](https://t.co/wuzbHFbxQK)

Currently dealing with an online date picker that needs me to find my date of birth one month at a time from 1897.

It is frustrating to have a surname that autocorrect likes to change. Especially when that correction might cost €110.
