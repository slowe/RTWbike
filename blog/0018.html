				<h2 class="title">Pyramid-Tahoe bike trail</h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-04-29T10:30:00+PDT" datetime="2014-04-29T10:30:00+PDT">Tuesday 29th Apr 2014 (10:30 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>Chris was going to show me the way to Reno that avoided the freeway but he needed to get to work at a reasonable time so that meant an early start. We set off at 7am on a route which met up with old parts of Lincoln Highway. We crossed a few tressel railway bridges and the going was tough in the loose rock with my heavy back-end. At one point I fell over and later discovered I'd lost my rear light. In this fall my Garmin GPS turned itself off and I lost the track through the Truckee Canyon.</p>
				
				<p>This morning's route was probably the closest to Stevens' route I've been. There were even moments trundling along the timbers of the railroad track to cross the Truckee River.</p>

				<p>We hit the Pyramid-Tahoe trail and I had to get off and push my bike a few more times. As we crossed into Nevada we hit paved roads. A few miles later, at about 10.30am we stopped by the river in Reno at the Hub coffee shop. I was impressed by the iPad till that displayed a periodic table of drinks on it.</p>
