Today was a rest day for knee recovery. I'd have slept longer this morning but a gentleman sharing the dorm room decided to clatter about for an hour and a half getting ready.

I finally got reliable access to the hostel WiFi once most of the school groups had left for the day. I caught up with online stuff then bought a Baguette from a local shop. I ate it with some goat's cheese, an avocado and some bananas from a very nice local market. Then it was back to the hostel to eat and do laundry. Not perhaps the normal way to spend time in Paris but I needed rest.
