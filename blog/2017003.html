				<p>The adventure 
				has begun.</p>
				
				<p>It was an early start this 
				morning. Having packed up all my belongings 
				and stored them with friends (thanks Noel 
				and Anne) and family, I had spent the night 
				at my sister's. This morning she made me 
				porridge, we said our goodbyes, then <a href="">she 
				waved me off</a>.</p>
				
				<p>I rode down to Leeds 
				station to get the 06:52 train to 
				Manchester airport. I'd booked ahead to get 
				a space for my bike but it turned out it 
				was full of luggage and none of the owners 
				wanted to shift them. So I had to stand 
				with my bike for an hour and a half. So 
				much for getting some extra sleep on the 
				train.</p>
				
				<p>At Manchester airport I had to pack 
				my bike into the huge transparent plastic 
				bag for the flight. I sat for ages trying 
				to get the left-hand pedal off. I tried 
				turning both ways but just couldn't budge 
				it. Just as I rang a friend for advice, a 
				guy who'd been in the queue came over and 
				offered a hand. Tom, it turns out, does 
				mountain bike training and he managed to 
				loosen it. Thanks Tom.</p>
				
				<p>After finally 
				getting the bike packed (with bubble wrap 
				over important parts) and my panniers 
				combined into my Ikea bag, I took 
				everything to special baggage. There I met 
				a couple of parkrunners from back home. It 
				turned out they were off to do the midnight 
				marathon in Tromso and were on the same 
				flight to Oslo. It's a small world 
				(although my legs disagree).</p>
				
				<p>On the flight 
				I was sat next to a young couple. One of 
				the guys had an old film camera he'd picked 
				up on eBay for &pound;3. Apparently you can 
				still get film developed at Boots. Who 
				knew? It is great to see they are still 
				getting used but I'm not sure I'd swap my 
				DSLR for one. Half my kit would end up 
				being rolls of film.</p>
				
				<p>Touching down at Oslo 
				airport the scenery said Norway. The hills, 
				the houses, the forests of tall spruce 
				trees stretching up to touch us. After a 
				few hours at Oslo airport I took my second 
				flight on to Kirkenes. A lady at the help 
				desk pronounced it "chirk-i-ness" but 
				various tannoy announcements said it 
				differently so I'm none the wiser. Rather 
				concerningly, as I borded the plane I 
				glimpsed a bike under the plane but it 
				wasn't in a bike bag. Was it mine? I 
				couldn't quite tell. Had something happened 
				to it? Was I going to be stranded with a 
				broken bike? Perhaps I had nothing to worry 
				about. Perhaps someone else was cycling the 
				route. I hoped that was the answer as I 
				nervously drank the little cup of tea they 
				gave me on the flight.</p>
				
				<p>Kirkenes is pretty 
				much the end of Norway. A few miles further 
				and you're in Russia. But that isn't where 
				I'm going. For the next four days I head 
				northward and westward to Nordkapp. The 
				plan is to reach it by the Summer Solstice 
				so that I'm at my most northern point at 
				the same time as the Sun. After that both 
				of us head south.</p>
				
				<p>So, I have over 500km of 
				remote countryside to go in four days. I'll 
				start tomorrow so that I have chance to 
				find supplies in Kirkenes. Most importantly 
				I'll need some gas for my camp stove and 
				food. Plenty of food.</p>
