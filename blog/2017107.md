Having ridden all day over many hills  I was disappointed to discover that the campsite I'd aimed for all day was closed. I headed back up to Soto de Lui&ntilde;a. I asked at one hotel. They said there was the Albergue but it was full and I wasn't a pilgrim. Their hotel rooms were &euro;35 but the lady said there might be someyhing cheaper in the middle. The bar in the centre had an Albergue. No go for me. I feel like a second class citizen. They sent me to another hotel. This was &euro;30 so I took it having no cheaper option. It has exceeded my daily budget but he upside is that I can have my first bath in 102 days.
