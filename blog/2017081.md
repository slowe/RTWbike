Already done some sheep herding this morning.

That's our local star doing its impression of a pulsar. ;)

I could get two eclairs for £1.25 or four for £1.

I am almost at Pendine after 132 km.

I have pitched my tent and some nice people made me a cup of tea ☕

The campsite children have been asking me lots of questions. A popular one was how do you fit in that tent?

For once it is a beautiful, clear, night. Unfortunately I can only see some stars as my glasses are lost somewhere in Connemara.

This type of infrastructure stops a variety of bikes and some disabled access. Not helpful.

There are times I wonder if the people designating cycle routes deliberately choose the hardest, steepest, and most round-the-houses routes.

All to take you quieter ways. Except the narrow, single-track, roads usually have vehicles speeding along them more dangerously.

I've lost a lot of trust in cycle infrastructure in the UK. It often is worse/slower/bumpier than just being on the road.

It often makes you give way at every side road, makes you switch sides of the road, and often just randomly ends after a short distance.
