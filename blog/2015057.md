In Stevens' day he said the morning calls to prayer woke him at 5am. They seem to be at 3.30am for me. I had breakfast on the rooftop breakfast bar.

Ice cream stop. I'm hugging the coast to avoid the much warned about D100. Getting there.

Just been asked for directions! Tried to explain that I'm not from around here.

A bit stuck. Back tracking.

Had my own seven minutes of terror.

A man in a white van stopped to say hello in Turkish. He wanted me to follow him. I think he is buying me a cola.

Istanbul cycling can be quite stressful when the bike lanes stop. I've checked into a hostel and had a shower now so feel more relaxed.
