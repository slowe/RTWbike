				<h2 class="title">Wind and a wheel </h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-16T22:00+0100 " datetime="2017-07-16T22:00+0100 ">Sunday 16th Jul 2017 (21:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It had rained in the night but was relatively ok as I set off. As I reached the western end of the island and a place called Dryna it started to rain. Not so dry in Dryna. As I took to ferry over to Brattv&aring;g the rain set in. The temperature drops when it rains. It gets closer to the temperature of the ocean. Rather than take the National Cycle Route 1 on a big diversion around the coast, I took the high road up and through a tunnel. Out the other side I had a nice straight road down that I could take full use of. I had the wind behind me. The rain got worse.</p>

				<p>At the end of the fjord I bought food in the only shop open and then sheltered in the door of a Thai food hut. The rain wasn't stopping so I pressed on. Now the wind was against me too.</p>

				<p>As I passed into a different fjord it became broken showers but I still had a bit of wind against me. At Spjelkavika I had a choice. Take the road south to a ferry or into &Aring;lesund where there was a longer ferry. The timetable I got last night suggested they were about the same price. &Aring;lesund it was then. There was a bike/pedestrian path most of the way into town but it kept changing sides and had bad curbs and bumpy stretches. At one point my rear brakes nearly failed. I adjusted them. A bit further along I realised they were juddering. I checked my wheel. It was cracked on the rim. Again?! It was Sunday. Everywhere was closed. Do I go back to Spjelkavika and wait for morning. That would cost time and money. Neither of which I have spare. I pressed on. </p>

				<p>I took the ferry out of &Aring;lesund. Except the ticket seller said this wasn't a ferry and rather than being about 40 krones as suggested by my ferry timetable, this not-a-ferry-ferry was 115 krones. Drat. We had already set off (they set off before you buy your ticket). This day was getting worse.</p>
				
				<p>I disembarked in the rain. I went up a hill hoping the houses would stop so I could wild camp. Near the top of the long hill I found the only flat bit of land away from houses I could. It was basically a bog. There were a million midges. My pegs would hardly stay in. I had to take my wet things inside my tent. I made food inside my tent and hoped the water level of the bog didn't rise. It would be like Nebraska all over again and I had no toilet block to escape to.</p>
