				<h2 class="title">Back to Spain</h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-13T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-10-13T23:59+0200">Friday 13th Oct 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>David and I were off by 9.15am. We kept a fast pace up for the next couple of hours before stopping to buy (and eat) some jicy oranges from a roadside stand. Then we rode to the border and caught the ferry over the river. I think David was happy to be back in Spain after 12 days. He had cycled 1142 km and the entire coast of Portugal.</p>

				<p>The ferry was reasonable &euro;3.50 (they charge for bicycles) and we saw big jellyfish in the river as we crossed.</p>

				<p>Back on Spanish soil we headed on. We were immediately faced with a 20% gradient hill which was tough after a few days of gentle roads. We raced on to Lepe where David was meeting a friend who had driven down to give him a lift home. They were going to have a couple of days break first. We shared beers at a bar in the centre and then said our farewells. It has been really nice to share the last day or so with David. I think he is planning a much longer trip in the future. Perhaps we'll meet again on the road some day.</p>

				<p>I lost an hour crossing the border. I prefer to think of it as giving back the hour I was given when entering Portugal. I updated one of my phones but forgot the other.</p>
				
				<p>I was now riding on alone. At the next town I visited a Carrefour and then sat eating food for an hour. Eventually I realised my phone I'd been checking for the time was an hour out and I really needed to move on. Back into the fierce heat I cycled after applying more suncream.</p>

				<p>I reached the campsite in Mazag&oacute;n just before sunset as has become the norm in the last week. It was &euro;7 and was really popular. The first spot I tried to pitch my tent was awful. Just under a surface of loose sand was concrete. Tent pegs don't work in those conditions.</p>
