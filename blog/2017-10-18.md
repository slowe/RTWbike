There was me thinking I'd be cycling along some of the Mediterranean but the Atlantic wasn't done with me.

Soon I'll be catching trains from San Fernando to Málaga. Flight home is tonight.

There was a big storm overnight. This morning it is raining.

Having someone plan things for me is soooooo nice. Was able to show the ticket seller @astrofrog's detailed itinerary of train times.

Future self: Another 5000 km.

I've cycled over 14,000 miles on 2 continents and in over 15 countries. I have observations about drivers.

How safe I feel on a bicycle depends on driving styles. Those vary with country and within a country.

One factor is population density. Higher population density tends to match with more aggressive, inconsiderate, driving.

The other, probably much bigger, factor in safe shared road use seems to be the law. Perhaps, specifically, minimum passing distances.

I noticed it passing through states in the US (some States require 3ft, others don't) but also crossing borders in Europe.

In France and Spain I found motorists to be much better with cyclists than in, say, the UK or Portugal.

I wish I'd been able to get another @WeAreCyclingUK bike bag but it wasn't possible in the time.

Rang my dad. He tells me my sister has gone to pick me up from Manchester. Which is odd because I'm flying to Leeds.

He told me I better ring her. That sounds great to make me sort it out. If only Skype didn't then stop letting anyone hear me.

Oh, and I'll be boarding soon.

So, any of my relatives, please ring her for me as I now can't. Thanks.

OK. My dad got it wrong.

Getting ready to board my flight home.
