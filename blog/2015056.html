				<p>I had a haircut in &Ccedil;orlu. That feels much better. </p>

				<p>As I was leaving &Ccedil;orlu I popped into a petrol station to use the toilet. As I left a guy shouted "Bradley Wiggins" to me! Perhaps I need a shave.</p>
				
				<p>I know I can only average 6mph in big cities due to lights, traffic, navigation, stress stops. A capital takes the best part of a day. It would be quicker if I knew the streets and drivers but when you are new to them, more care is needed. That takes more time. The upshot is that I will give myself all day tomorrow to go the last 30 miles as lots of people have told me, Istanbul requires more care.</p>
				
				<p>Hello Sea of Marmara and... umm... Newport? </p>

				<p>In getting my wheel into the Sea of Marmara I also got my shoes wet. At least all the holes let the water back out. ;)</p>

				<p>The last proper shower I had was at the campsite in Bulgaria. Feeling that I'd like to stop smelling so badly, I checked in to a cheap hotel in Silivri mostly for the benefit of a shower. It is lovely here in Silivri.</p>

				<p>I was really glad to get off the D100 a few miles before Silivri as its hard shoulder was getting sketchy and the traffic was increasing. I really don't want to be on it the rest of the way into Istanbul.</p>

				<p>At 6.22pm it is quite exciting to hear calls to prayer echoing out over the rooftops. As the evening progressed I had food at a local restaurant and was joined by an ex-journalist, now English teacher who was keen to practice his English skills. I walked around the lively harbour and admired Jupiter and Venus close together in the sky.</p>
