First trip this morning was to the Post Office to get a new passport. This one is for the Wild Atlantic Way and let's you collect stamps from places along it. You get a certificate if you complete it.

At Greencastle there was a planetarium but the next show was two hours away so I rode on. There was a pointless out and back to a little lighthouse and beach then a steep hill to climb. It was very steep ups and downs for the next few miles. I was offered a tow up one but politely declined the offer despite my lack of gears.

Late in the afternoon I reached Malin Head which is the most northerly point in mainland Ireland. There I met Jenny and Claire who had cycled from Mizen Head - Ireland's most southerly point - over the past two weeks.

I ended up staying at the hostel near Malin Head so got to chat with them a bit more about their trip. I also had a long conversation with Lucy, a PE teacher from the USA, who has been coming here for years. Later in the evening I chatted to Veronique, a French lady, who was visiting Ireland with her family. She really wanted to see the northern lights and was sad when I said the forecasts (aurora and weather) weren't good. I found myself explaining how the aurora are formed into the night.
