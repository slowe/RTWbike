No Google Maps, I don't go here often. I've never been in fact. This is probably the __only__ time I will ever do this route.

Machine learning has a way to go. Or it's deliberately trying to make me think it isn't all that clever.

I meant pannier rack (carrier) of course. Still using my original panniers.

A man with a Welcome to Waterville bumper sticker just angrily gesticulated at me to clear off. In Waterville.

It wasn't confined to me. He then parked on crosshatching, got out, went and opened some car doors and did the same to some drivers too.

Dropping down below cloud level gives more of a view. You do feel as though you're scraping your head on the ceiling.
