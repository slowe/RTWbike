				<h2 class="title">Munich to Altoetting</h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-27T21:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-27T21:00:00+0200">Wednesday 27th May 2015 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>

				<p>At breakfast I had an interesting conversation with Ashley from 
				Tennessee about cultural differences and similarities. With a late start 
				I headed out of Munich only stopping to buy some cheese and German bread 
				in the market. This morning was threatening rain and I was heading 
				towards black clouds. Thankfully they seemed to be going in the same 
				direction. Out of the suburbs I had bike tracks through forest. They 
				were well signed for local towns and these ones were even better by 
				listing bigger places as much as 28km away. That is much more useful for 
				the long distance cyclist. The riding was pleasant and my knees were 
				able to cope with the gentle hills. For five minutes I had a little rain 
				shower but after that I was able to put my waterproofs away. </p>
				
				<p>By 3pm I 
				had reached Haag and I rewarded myself with an icecream. I hit the 
				pleasant Inn valley and was surprised how big the Inn river was. </p>
				
				<p>Following the Inn Trail I caught up with Michel and Connie - a German 
				couple spending three days on the Inn trail - so accompanied them to 
				Mulhdorf where I saw the covered arcades mentioned by Stevens. Here I 
				said goodbye and joined the trail again as I had another 10 miles to 
				Altoetting. About half way there I took my phone out for a picture and 
				found the screen had mysteriously cracked. Disaster! It would no longer 
				respond. I was stranded without communication.</p>
				
				<p>Arriving in Altoetting I pushed past the closed shops selling crucifixes and assorted paraphernalia.</p>
