It was nice to bump into Arie (who I met at the top of the Gap of Mamore) again this morning.

In the bike shop in Ballina I finally found a suitable hanger (the bit that holds the derailleur to the frame) which Oggy had said to get.

Because Oggy had noted that mine was slightly bent. I panicked and now have two spares now.

Right. Another 50 km to go today.

I am now camping at a youth hostel (&euro;8!). Have had a shower. Just eaten a starter of 3 fried egg sandwiches. Next is curry and rice.
