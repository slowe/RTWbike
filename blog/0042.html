				<h2 class="title">Evanston rest day</h2>

				<p>Being ahead of Stevens I had a rest day in Evanston. It wasn't the best day for it as pretty much everywhere except for the motorway services were closed. I walked along the Bear River Greenway. The river itself was in full flow as seems to be expected for May. I wandered around the old town and admiring the now defunct railroad station. It is such a shame that there aren't really passenger services any more.</p>

				<p>I walked up the hill to <em>Subway</em> for lunch. <em>Subway</em> isn't great but it was open and was becoming my most reliable place on the road to get actual vegetable matter. I bought a pink of milk in the services shop only to discover that a US pint is only 473 ml compared to a British 568 ml. Presumably that applies to pints of beer too - Americans are losing out on almost 100 ml!</p>
				
				<p>On-route back to the RV park I stopped to watch some people surfing the standing waves in the Bear River. I sat in the RV park laundry to do some clothes washing and charge my phone. My phone told me I was now "roaming".</p>
