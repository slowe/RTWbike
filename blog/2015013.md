__INTERMISSION: I'd been writing blog posts about the days from Paris on my phone and hadn't got around to posting them. Unfortunately, my phone screen broke in Alt&ouml;tting, Germany which meant I couldn't access them. I left a gap here for them. Now that I'm back home, and my phone is fixed, normal service can be resumed.__
