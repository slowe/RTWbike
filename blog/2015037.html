				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-10T20:00:00+CEDT" datetime="2015-06-10T20:00:00+CEDT">Wednesday 10th Jun 2015 (20:00 CEDT)</time></div>
				<p>In the morning I took full use of the buffet breakfast and then got my things loaded on my bike for the 10 am check out. As I set off I realised the rear brakes were rubbing against the wheel. This must have been why I was so exhausted yesterday afternoon; I'd been struggling against far more friction than normal. Unloading my bike I discovered that I'd broken a spoke on the rear wheel and the wheel was not running true. I couldn't deal with another day of effort like yesterday so I switched out the new brakes for my old, worn-down ones so that the wheel could run freely. </p>
				
				<p>I needed to find a bike shop and thankfully there was one - Kelly's Bikes. In I went and, pointing to my bike, I was able to indicate that I needed my spoke fixing. I said I'd cycled from Liverpool and was going to Istanbul. Thankfully "Liverpool" and "Istanbul" are recognisable words. &Ouml;rs, the bike shop mechanic said "one hour" so I left my bike and my bags with him and his twin brother Kende. I was leaving my only means of transport and my belongings with people I'd never met before but a long distance cyclist learns to give their trust to local bike shops.</p>

				<p>Whilst I was waiting I sat in the town square where they had free wifi. A girl came up to me and said "can you give me a number between 1 and 21". I thought I'd misheard her at first because it is a weird question. I hadn't misheard her. That was her question. I still don't know why.</p>
				
				<p>Back at Kelly's Bikes, &Ouml;rs and Kende had not only fixed my spoke but had put new brakes on for me. Amazingly they wouldn't charge me because I was on such a big ride. As thanks, I decided to purchase some cycling gloves from them as my hands had been getting a little tingly anyway and I'd left my last pair of gloves at home. I can't begin to say thank you enough for the amazing generosity of people I've met since San Francisco.</p>
				
				<p>It was already afternoon when I rolled out of Szeksz&aacute;rd (singing "Every<strike>thing</strike>one is awesome" to myself) and I'd decided I was heading back across the Danube to the EV6 rather than struggle with the no-bike signs of highway 6. The route east was long and straight and I wasn't entirely sure if it would get me to the M9 bridge over the Danube but it did via a local forest park and some farm tracks.</p>

				<p>It was great to be back on the EV6 even if occasional cars drove down it (ignoring the "no car" signs). As I reached Baja I found a huge Tesco where my hunter-gatherer mode kicked in and I stocked up on high-calorie food as I didn't know what to expect in Croatia. Every little helps.</p>

				<p>At Dunaflava I had missed the day's last ferry to Dunaszekcs&#337; where Stevens had stayed at Igali's house. Dunaszekcs&#337; would have to wait until tomorrow morning. I saw a "rooms for cyclists" sign in English which was promising. It turned out to be a nice guest house for cyclists on the EV6. I had a shower and then enjoyed "grapefruit beer" and a homemade lemonade courtesy of Susan and William whose house it was. They showed me their impressive vegetable garden and I sampled their cherry, apple, & apricot p&aacute;linka.</p>

				<p>After the hard slog and exhaustion of yesterday, today has been lovely.</p>
