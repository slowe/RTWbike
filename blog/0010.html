				<h2 class="title">Davis to Sacramento</h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-04-23T22:43+PDT" datetime="2014-04-23T22:43+PDT">Wednesday 23rd Apr 2014 (22:43 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I arrived at Davis following the route Jim Fisk had suggested. Jim had said it was the most bike friendly city in the USA and I noticed that even the trash cans had a Penny Farthing on them. There were lots of bike lanes in Davis, lots of people on bikes and lots of bike stands so it lives up to the reputation.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, my plan was to reach Sacramento that afternoon so I didn't get to enjoy the friendliness for long. I found the bike route heading east that runs between the railroad and I-80. Part way along the on-road bike path graduates into a totally separate path that runs right next to the I-80. Although there are vehicles heading along at Freeway speeds a couple of metres away, there is a big barrier. You also get a nice view of the Yolo nature reserve and the snow capped Sierra Nevadas in the far distance.</p>

				<p>At the point where the bike route rose to run alongside the I-80 I stopped to take some pictures. As I did I spotted a bank card at the side of the path right next to me. I picked it up and rang the bank number on the back. After explaining I didn't have an account I asked what I should do with it. They told me to take it to a police station so I said I'd hand it in at Sacramento.</p>
				
				<p>I rolled into Sacramento and, after crossing the Sacramento River, I saw the wide tree-lined boulevards mentioned by Thomas Stevens were still there along with a great view of the capital building.</p>

				<p>After checking in at the Youth Hostel I found the Sheriff's office with the help of a friendly lady who worked for the transit authority and knew someone from Hemel Hempstead. The sheriff (or perhaps it was a deputy) was taking down the flags outside as he was about to close up for the day. He was pretty friendly and took the bank card and my details down. After being helped out at Fisk's cycles this was my turn to pay it forward.</p>
				
				<p>It turns out the building the Youth Hostel occupies was built in 1885 so it was nice to get an idea of the type of thing Stevens would have seen.</p>
				
				<p>In the large dormitory I got chatting to a man named Todd. He decided I needed to be told lots of stories about cougars including the close encounters he has had and how they can easily jump over 8ft high fences. He told me I should have a gun.</p>
				
				<p>I'd seen online that there was a Geeks Who Drink pub quiz night that night so I headed to the bar/diner/restaurant it was supposed to be taking place in. It turned out that not enough people had shown up so it was cancelled. An early night it was.</p>
