				<p>The youth hostel I was staying at was on the large 'island' created by a split in the Danube. It was actually a few miles from most of the main tourist sites and seemed largely to be be visited by large school groups. As I sat on the floor in the reception area - the only place the wifi was available - an angry looking man came through the door. He gave me an evil looking stare as he went by. The hostel was huge so I reasoned that the chances of him being in the same room as me were small. A little later when I got back to the room I was pleased to find it empty. However, a few minutes later, he turned up. He was my room mate and he'd had a bit to drink. It turned out he'd missed his last train or bus home from Vienna. Thankfully he wasn't a beligerant drunk but he still made me nervous. I kept my important possessions (money, passport, phone) very close throughout the night. In the morning he left and I stayed in bed for a while.</p>

				<p>I was in a major capital city full of sights but I really needed to do some laundry. The hostel, despite its size, didn't have any laundry facilities. They told me of a laundrette two miles away. Thankfully I had a bike so that wasn't a worry for me. <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/605364839469461505">I did my washing</a>. It is nice to have fresh smelling clothes. I also visited the supermarket. I was really living it up in Vienna.</p>
				
				<p>On Tuesday, I decided to visit the Vienna Wanderers' Bicycle Club as Stevens had done. The problem is that they don't exist any more and neither does the street they were on; Schwimmschulenstrasse. <a href="https://twitter.com/Reesiepie/status/605425446864461825">Marie O'Sullivan on Twitter</a> managed to find out that it was near the station (<a href="http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=116717&imageview=true">grid reference F3 in an old map of Vienna</a>) only Schwimmschulenstrasse between 1873-1919. It was now Lassallestrasse. Even though the bicycle club didn't exist, I visited anyway and rode the length of the street. Afterwards I stumbled across an impromptu solar system scale model in the street near the station that was organised by the Zeiss Planetarium Wien. I then wandered over to the big wheel and had a ride through the large park. I then cycled over to the main part of the city and whiled away the afternoon snoozing in the pleasant Rathausplatz park near the Rathaus (town hall).</p>

				<p>Wednesday was my last full day in Vienna so I went to the MuseumsQuartier to visit _mumok_ - the museum of modern art. It had everything from David Hockney (<a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606073606028853249">pleased to see him labelled as "Bradford, Yorkshire"</a>) to Yoko Ono to videos of naked bodies having paint thrown at them. Outside the MuseumsQuartier was a <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606152094505177089">vegan festival</a> and I had a very nice vegan curry with lassi. As I left the festival I saw a young woman on a zebra-stripe bike adorned with roses. She told me it was some kind of pun as the German words for zebra and bike are similar.</p>
