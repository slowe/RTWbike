Aside from briefly being woken by the musical call-to-prayer at 3.30am, I slept about 12 hours.

200 km to go. Not sure if it is quiet due to Sunday or Ramadan.

So far, in almost every shop I've been in the owner has followed me around. It is slightly disconcerting.

I stopped at what looked like a little cafe with some men outside drinking tea (chai). I bought some then the men bought me a second. We shared almost no language. There were pantomimic gestures, a few words of German, and I learnt the word for flat in Turkish: d&uuml;z. Brill!

I decided to cycle on ahead of Thomas Steven. I have better roads and want to make the most of the relative quiet today.

I think the rain clouds are surrounding me.

Remembering some things that Tess and Francesca had told me in Serbia, I asked some guys working at a petrol station if there was camping nearby. I mentioned that I had cycled from Liverpool. They're Chelsea fans but said I could camp around the back of the petrol station! Behind the petrol station the ground was more suited for tent pegs than the real campsite I stayed in in Edirne! They also showed me the toilet. Such great hospitality.

There is no shower here but then I didn't get much of a shower in Edirne because they ran out of water due to filling their pool.

I finished the day a little short of &Ccedil;orlu. Tomorrow I'm going to head for Silivri.
