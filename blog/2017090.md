Very nearly doored by somebody not looking as they got out of their car on a narrow road. Always look.

Now having haddock and chips in Plymouth. I chose the haddock because it is from Osterfjord in Norway. I've cycled past that on this trip.

Took the 3pm ferry from Cremyll to Plymouth.

It has been roughly 7860 km (4880 miles) to Plymouth. Phew.

Where does the Atlantic end and The Channel begin? I decided Plymouth felt about right.

Massive thanks to Tina and Anne at Brittany Ferries for their help this evening and for upgrading me. I shall start start France well rested.

Unexpected acts of kindness can get pretty emotional at this stage in an endurance trip. Probably everything gets emotional now.
