Well hello #Eurovelo1 route signs. Nice to see you again. It's been about 6700 km so far. How far do we have to go?

Nearly brought off my bike by two big farm dogs running right out in front of me.

Tintern Abbey and the man from the tearooms. The tearooms have a FB group. He said I should mention my story on it.â€¦ [](https://t.co/iVpuEdF4NE)

Goodbye Ireland. Ferry++.

Ireland's sunny south east lived up to its reputation. Can south Wales give me some good weather too? Os gwelwch yn dda.

Well this was badly planned. Am in Fishguard but it is dark and I didn't get a response from a campsite anyway. May just sit in the terminal

Although there is a strange French (?) man whose only English consists of biblical verses and I can't understand his French.

I'm back in the UK so free WiFi is no longer free and straightforward.
