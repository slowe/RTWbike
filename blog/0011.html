				<p>I had a late start as I had to find AA batteries for my GPS as my rechargables were all dead. I followed the imaginatively named <em>American River</em> where I met a cyclist who took my photo for me.</p>

				<p>After Sacramento I headed towards the mountains following the railroad lines on frontage roads as much as possible. I didn't know what a "frontage road" was until planning for this trip. They tend to be roads that run alongside railroad lines or freeways. They are generally quiet, not brilliantly maintained, and often the only non-motorway option. They are usually called "Frontage Road" too in the standard, American, no-nonsense naming approach.</p>

				<p>I reached Rocklin in the afternoon and, after visiting the local Chamber of Commerce (these are the equivalent of tourist information offices), found a motel. At the front desk I met Lalit who quickly brought his colleague Amit to meet me on hearing my story. I asked if I could take their picture and they asked if they could take pictures with me to share on their Facebook pages.</p>
