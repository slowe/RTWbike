Yesterday evening and today are exactly the same weather as Thomas Stevens had yesterday and today in 1885. Rain. Today's cycle singing will be rain themed. Singing in the rain. Why does it always rain on me? Raindrops keep falling on my head.

Had a little detour to see a canyon.

I think I'm amongst some impressive mountains. Shame they're all clagged in.

I climbed miles up into the mountains on the only road then suddenly I get a "cars only" sign. What's that about Serbia? I've no alternative
