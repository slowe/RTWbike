I had a haircut in &Ccedil;orlu. That feels much better.

As I was leaving &Ccedil;orlu I popped into a petrol station to use the toilet. As I left a guy shouted "Bradley Wiggins" to me! Perhaps I need a shave.

I know I can only average 6mph in big cities due to lights, traffic, navigation, stress stops. A capital takes the best part of a day. It would be quicker if I knew the streets and drivers but when you are new to them, more care is needed. That takes more time. The upshot is that I will give myself all day tomorrow to go the last 30 miles as lots of people have told me, Istanbul requires more care.

Hello Sea of Marmara and... umm... Newport?

In getting my wheel into the Sea of Marmara I also got my shoes wet. At least all the holes let the water back out. ;)

The last proper shower I had was at the campsite in Bulgaria. Feeling that I'd like to stop smelling so badly, I checked in to a cheap hotel in Silivri mostly for the benefit of a shower. It is lovely here in Silivri.

I was really glad to get off the D100 a few miles before Silivri as its hard shoulder was getting sketchy and the traffic was increasing. I really don't want to be on it the rest of the way into Istanbul.

At 6.22pm it is quite exciting to hear calls to prayer echoing out over the rooftops. As the evening progressed I had food at a local restaurant and was joined by an ex-journalist, now English teacher who was keen to practice his English skills. I walked around the lively harbour and admired Jupiter and Venus close together in the sky.
