#notes Got advice on the hills ahead from the lady in the tourist information office in Lynton.

I chatted to some nice people on the coastal bridleway. The ladies on the right are from near Newport.

They said I should write a book. They said they'd want this picture in it. :)

Thanks to Kevin, previously a bike mechanic, for helping remove the derailleur and turn my bike into a fixed gear so I could cycle onwards.

He told me a mostly downhill route to a bike shop in Braunton. Got here at 5pm. Now buying a new derailleur. Thankfully I do have a hanger

Although, after all the trouble I had finding the right shaped hanger in Ireland, this bike shop has three of them.

I didn't get too far today thanks to hills, headwind, and a broken derailleur after Ilfracombe.
