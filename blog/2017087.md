I left some rubbish between my tent inner and outer. Some creature has just been trying to eat it. A hedgehog?

Not to be outdone by Devon, Cornwall just threw some 30% gradients at me. With wind. #NCN3

Tomorrow I should complete Lejog (Land's End to John O'Groats) backwards (N to S) the long way round (via the west coast of Ireland).

When I get home I'll be using Open Street Map to make a heatmap of every business with Atlantic in the name (and translations of Atlantic).

I expect the coastline to pop out.
