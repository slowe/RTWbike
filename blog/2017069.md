Tonight I had two packets of rice (each was two servings) with a huge jar of curry sauce and chicken. Oh and a Swiss roll meant for a family

After yesterday, a very late start, bad traffic, and so much wind, I was having a really hard day. Just slowly plugging away at the miles.

My plan was to camp at a hostel in Doolin. Camping at hostels has proved better than campsites in Ireland. Cheaper and better facilities.

Arrived at about 7.30 not feeling the happiest camper. It turned out the French lady from Westport was staying at the same hostel!

Then, Ciri (the American I rode with in North Scotland) showed up too! Seeing people again cheered me right up. A big dinner helped too.

I've had a great evening catching up with Ciri about her adventures since Ullapool. She won some events at a Highland Games!

We can both moan to each other about the rain (so much rain) and, having shared the experience, feel happy in our moaning because we get it.

I'm not explaining that we'll but it is perhaps cathartic. I'm much cheerier now as a result. So glad to have met Ciri again.

Lots of new geology today on The Burren.
