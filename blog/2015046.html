				<h2 class="title">To the Balkan Mountains</h2>

				<p>I left the campsite on top of the hill in Jagodina (J&#1072;&#1075;&#1086;&#1076;&#1080;&#1085;&#1072;) and headed down the other side. Not before getting a view of Jagodina itself.</p>

				<p>In nearby &Cacute;uprija (&#1035;&#1091;&#1087;&#1088;&#1080;&#1112;&#1072;) I stopped in a sports bar for a toilet trip followed by a drink because I felt guilty just using the facilities. In the main square there was a nice finger post showing where I've been and where I'm going.</p>

				<p>It was a lovely sunny day and I was starting to head up into the famous Balkan mountains. After the relative flat of the Danube since Austria, I knew the Balkan Mountains were my next (and last) major hills to get over. I wasn't really sure how steep they'd be. They couldn't be any worse than what I've been over on this trip.</p>

				<p>Off to the distance in the east was an amazingly conical mountain which made me think of Mt Fuji or mountains that kids would draw. It was very distinctive.</p>

				<p>I was now heading up the Morava valley but on a local road that wound its way from side to side of the major motorway that continues on towards Bulgaria and Turkey. After a drink stop in the same town where Stevens had lunch, I headed out of town a couple of miles following the edge of the hill. I decided to stop for lunch at a high bend that commanded a stunning view of the Morava valley. Weirdly, the blue skies, flat farmland, big highway, and distant mountains reminded me of <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/RTWbike/blog/0008.html">California between Fairfield and Davis</a>.</p>

				<p>The riding was fairly pleasant as most of the traffic was on the motorway. I arrived into Ni&scaron; (&#1053;&#1080;&#1096;) an hour ahead of Stevens.</p>
