				<h2 class="title">Mountain top midges </h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-09T23:00+0100" datetime="2017-07-09T23:00+0100">Sunday 09th Jul 2017 (22:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I awoke to rain. It had rained all through the night. I tried waiting for it to stop but who knew when that would be? I packed everything up inside as best as I could. Some water had got in via the old floor of my tent. As I finally emerged into the light rain I was mobbed by the midges. The sooner I left here the better. A wet tent was packed up.</p>

				<p>I was now following the route of the Dutch couple so left the 17 and National Cycle Route 1 to take smaller roads to the ferry at Hofles. on the way I briefly chatted to a German man walking Norway. Traffic and rain meant I didn't want to hold him up. Further on I met Rudi and Ava from Switzerland cycling from Trondheim to Troms&oslash;.</p>

				<p>Once through Kolvereid the rain 
				stopped and it seemed quicker.</p>

				<p>Somehow I ended up racing the ferry again and got to Hofles just before they had started loading. It cost 48 krones to travel south to L&uuml;nd. During the crossing the sun finally came out. I had feared I'd be stuck getting wetter and wetter for days. At L&uuml;nd, rather than cycle off, I took over a picnic bench to have a belated lunch and to finally dry the clothes I'd rinsed at the campsite two days ago. After a double fried egg sandwich, I treated myself to an ice-cream for 26 krones at the cafe as it was one of the few places to have been open today.</p>

				<p>The next ferry arrived and I waited for all the traffic to speed off before setting off myself. It was nice to be out of the rain but now I needed sun cream and had to take layers off due to the heat. The route headed up a 120 metre hill. Near the top I had a scramble up some rocks and got a glorious view in two directions. I hadn't gone as far as I'd planned but I resolved to camp here tonight. There was only the tricky matter of getting tent pegs in. Then my nemesis returned. No, not the rain, the midges! I retreated into my tent as the only midge-free place. I was denied the enjoyment of the view.</p>
