Crossed over the M4. A man in a car stopped and asked are you cycling the coastal route? "Yes", I replied with a chuckle. "Where did you start?" he continued. "At the top of Norway" I replied. There's a pause as he realises I didn't say somewhere in Wales. :)

Enjoying some sandwiches, made by Chris North, in a bus shelter by the A48.

I met Ed who, having just recently cycled from Cork to Limerick then Dublin with his sister, is cycling Lands End to John O'Groats.

Safe and sound at Sheena and Alistair's house. So great to catch up with them. They have provided me a fantastic meal.
