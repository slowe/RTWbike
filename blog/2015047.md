The people of Ni&scaron; are certainly happy that their team won the U20 world cup. Lots of beeping cars sporting Serbian flags this morning.

Watching Murray vs Troicki with a Serb in Ni&scaron;. I actually cycled right by The Queen's Club on the way here about 6 weeks ago.

My ability to read Cyrillic characters is slowly improving.

Having traditional Serbian food and drink in Ni&scaron;. It is cheaper to buy 500ml of beer than 330ml!

Dinner consisted of pork ribs with a sort of salty clotted cream, bread, and a tomato & pepper salad.
