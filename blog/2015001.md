After having completed the US leg of Thomas Stevens' journey, I am about to embark on the second. This will follow his route from Liverpool, England to Istanbul, Turkey. He had arrived in Liverpool on April 19 by ship from New York. He set off from Edge Hill church at 4pm on Saturday May 2nd. That is today. My dad is about to give me a lift over to Liverpool. I will try to update my blog more this time but otherwise I will [still be on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rtwbike).
