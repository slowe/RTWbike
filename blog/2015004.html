				<p>After an attempted ride on Gordon's tricycle, in which I couldn't steer and headed for a ditch, I set off south to Stafford. South some more took me under the M6 and on the hunt for a toilet. This is surprisingly difficult on a Bank Holiday Monday as nowhere is open. After asking lots of clueless locals, I eventually found one in Bloxwich where I also stopped for a late lunch. Getting into big cities is slow going so I was glad to find a canal trail that took me to the site of the old tricycle works which long ago closed down. I stopped briefly for a picture at the fantastic library building.</p>

				<p>My right knee had started hurting yesterday and it was making it difficult to get up the little steep bridges on the towpath of the canals.</p>

				<p>Out of Birmingham I was on main road which wasn't to bad. Over the border into Warwickshire the roads became more rural and I stopped at Allesley, on the outskirts of Coventry, for the night.</p>
