				<h2 class="title">EHIC to the rescue</h2>

				<p>I have a head cold and an itchy rash on my feet, legs, and arms. :(</p>
				
				<p>I probably need to find a public health centre (EHIC) but can't navigate <a href="https://t.co/eUXIwharQx"></a> I'm in Viveiro.</p>
				
				<p>I took an antihistamine last night but it hasn't helped.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DK4B-x-WsAAfchh.jpg" alt="landscape" title="Rash" /><figcaption>Rash</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I'm hoping it is hives from the exertion of the past three days.</p>
				
				<p>I visited the local public health centre. Quite understandably, nobody really spoke English (or French). Google translate was our friend.</p>
				
				<p>I'm glad I had my EHIC card with me. The only confusion was my US travel visa as it looks like a photo page so they thought I was American.</p>
				
				<p>But we managed to clear that up and get to the right page in my passport showing I was from the EU.</p>
				
				<p>I joined a queue to see a doctor. I only had to wait 10 minutes. She prescribed an injection and some antihistamines for the next 5 days.</p>
				
				<p>I then went downstairs where I was given two injections in my buttocks. It was Urbason. The second was quite painful and I got lightheaded</p>
				
				<p>The second doctor checked my blood pressure and I had a rest for a few minutes. She told me to take some juice or coffee with sugar.</p>
				
				<p>It is quite scary getting treatment when you can't really communicate because you don't know the language and people don't know yours.</p>
				
				<p>But credit to the Spanish health service for seeing to me quickly, professionally, and kindly. You realise how lucky we are in Europe.</p>
				
				<p>My EHIC card means the only cost to me was Euro 4.40 for the prescription. They also told me to rest as the pills would make me drowsy.</p>
				
				<p>So I checked into a cheap hotel. I'm going to eat and rest. Hopefully the rash will go down.</p>
				
				<p>All this is a reminder of the important care the folks at @MSF_uk provide to those in much harder situations <a href="https://t.co/KohIMIW8v3"></a></p>
