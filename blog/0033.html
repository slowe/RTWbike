				<h2 class="title">Snow and a hill</h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-10T17:09:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-10T17:09:00+PDT">Saturday 10th May 2014 (17:09 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>Just before I left the RV park the owner said to me:</p>
				
				<p><blockquote>"Has anyone told you about <em>the hill</em>? No? Oh well, you'll find it."</blockquote></p>
				
				<p>With that ominous warning I packed my tent and headed to the nearby grocery store to get some vaseline to address some chaffing I'd been getting. As I traversed the outskirts of Wells it started to snow. By the entrance to the freeway I decided to stop in the McDonalds to contemplate my options. I used my international call time to ring my dad and get his advice. He was all for me having a rest day in Wells. After I finished my call a young guy came over to offer me a lift into Utah due to the "inclement weather". I offered my thanks but told him that it would be cheating. He smiled and went back to his coffee.</p>
				
				<p>By now there was a break in the weather and it looked more cheery. Being loathe to head backwards, I decided to head onwards. A few miles of freeway later I saw a front of snow heading towards me from the left. I got off the freeway at a junction and sheltered in the underpass. I put plastic carrier bags over my shoes to stop my feet getting wet. I put my rear light on for visibility. </p>
				
				<p>A little later the interstate passed through the <a href="http://doc.nv.gov/Facilities/WCC_Facility/">Wells Conservation Camp</a> - a prison work camp. The signs next to the freeway advised against stopping for hitchhikers. All very well for motorists but I was pretty sure an escaped convict would have no trouble getting my bike from me.</p>
				
				<p>It was tough going and then the road started to go upwards. In the US the upward inclines seem to keep going up from far longer than I'd expect. A few miles of continuous incline later I finally reached Pequop summit at 6946 feet where there was a very handy toilet block. I'd nearly climbed back up to the altitude of Donner Pass. The positive aspect of this was that I had a very long downhill run on the other side. Twenty-five miles or so from Wells I approached Oasis. Although I could see service station buildings, as I got closer they turned out to be abandoned and derelict. It felt like a modern day mirage as my hope of refreshment and warmth vanished in the high desert.</p>

				<p>At Oasis I took a 90 degree turn to the north onto NV233. I had a long 23 miles with occasional snow showers back to meet the railroad. At this point I got my first glimpse of the Pilot Peak range and, far to the left, Montello.</p>

				<p>I knew Montello was about 10 miles away even if it looked only three; I was now getting used to judging distances in the big country. Beyond Montello I could see a bank of rain heading my way. Could I reach Montello before it? No. Just under 5 miles from Montello the little settlement was engulfed. Not long later I was too. I finally reached the gas station/motel more than a little wet. I'd done just over 800 miles since Oakland. I checked in and had a nice warm bath.</p>
