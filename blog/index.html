				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-30T01:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-30T01:00+0100">Friday 30th Jun 2017 (00:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>In the morning I woke feeling warm. A little too warm. All the layers I've grown accustomed to wearing were unnecessary in strong sunlight. I had another dip in the Atlantic. I took my time having lots for breakfast.  I didn't want to leave this perfect slice of summer.</p>
				
				<p>I finally got on the way at 11am aware that I should aim for the 3pm ferry at Gryllefjord. The route went in and out of more bays then went up. Not more up my knees complained. Actually they were complaining a little less. Perhaps Christophe's oils have helped. Or perhaps it was just the sun.</p>

				<p>About 100 metres up there was a viewing platform. There were also several cyclists. Here I met Kristen and her dog Whisky from the UK. She was heading north. I also met Jonathan from Germany heading north. Then Agata from Poland arrived from the same direction as me. She was followed by Victoria and Ewan from Scotland/Finland. It was getting like Piccadilly Circus on the side of this mountain. Kristen warned of the tunnel ahead. We'd be going up for 1.9km inside it.</p>

				<p>I got going. At the start of the tunnel I got behind Victoria and Ewan as I felt we'd be safer in a more visible group. It wasn't that bad in the end and was shorter than the Nordkapp tunnel.</p>

				<p>Down the other side I let Victoria and Ewan go on ahead whilst I took photos. I reached a lovely bay with glorious blue water and some sandy beaches. This is the Arctic I kept reminding myself.</p>

				<p>I had to get a move on to catch that ferry otherwise I'd have a four hour wait for the next. Around the next corner my heat fell. I could see a road contouring up a big hill. As I got closer I saw there was also a tunnel. Which would it be? Thankfully the answer was the tunnel. It was new. It went downwards. It was well lit. Hooray. I sailed into Gryllefjord with 15 minutes to spare. At the ferry, as well as Victoria and Ewan, I met Robert and Martin who had both cycled from Germany. The coast of Norway is a popular route, clearly. </p>

				<p>The ferry took about 2 hours to get to Andenes. There I went to the Tourist information office and used to WiFi. As I headed out of town I reached a cross roads and was wondering why a camper van was driving so slowly across it. Then I spotted Alistair driving it. Sheena and Alistair were here! As it happens they'd got talking to Victoria and Ewan in a shop due to their Irn Bru tops and they said I was behind them. It was so nice to see Sheena and Alistair again.</p>

				<p>They were going to park in a swimming spot a few kilometres north of N&oslash;ss. It was 40km away. I didn't fancy 40km of hills. However, cycling along to Bleik I realised And&oslah;ya was different to what I've experienced so far. It was pretty flat. The wind was actually behind me. The sun was out. I forgave a suggested camping spot near Bleik and made the most of the favourable conditions. I sustained over 30km/h for a while.</p>

				<p>I reached the camping spot just after 8pm. Sheena and Alistair kindly let me eat in their van and Alistair opened a bottle of wine. We chatted long into the evening sharing stories. The midnight sun is a tricky thing. We hadn't realised the time. It was well after 1am but it had been an evening well spent. I went to bed under blue skies, happy.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-29T21:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-29T21:00+0100">Thursday 29th Jun 2017 (20:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>At breakfast I met Christophe again. He gave me some essential oils to rub on my knees. He wished me bon voyage.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDgbHFXXkAMBTED?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Christophe" /><figcaption>Christophe</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I had a slow start. It was threatening rain. I made my way across the tall bridge for the fifth and final time. I headed north and, after an older lady stopped on her bike to point me in the right direction, up and over the hill in the middle of Troms&oslash; island. There was a bike lane all the way past the airport and over the western bridge. I passed a ski-skater.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDgbgOmXYAABUTd?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Ski skating" /><figcaption>Ski skating</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>The going was a bit flatter which helped my knees. That was until the road turned left and I saw the ominous sign of a road barrier. It was up, so I could use the road, but its existence meant I was going to be going over a high pass. I got in the lowest gear and slogged up it.</p>
				
				<p>Over the top of the pass I freewheeled for a bit until I met Daniel who had cycled from Germany. We exchanged notes about our roads ahead. Daniel told me he'd camped on a lovely sandy beach on Senja, the island I was heading to next. We wished each other well and I rode on to B where there was a big queue of vehicles waiting for the ferry. Being on a bike I could head to the front.</p>

				<p>Whilst waiting for the ferry to arrive I got talking to a Norwegian lady who was going to Senja with her two daughters. She asked where I'd been and then asked if I'd seen the bear in Lyngenfjord that had made the newspaper. I think she was disappointed that I hadn't.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry arrived and took me over to Senja. A few km along the road I recognised the signs of a ride up into the mountains.  Oh my knees. Over the top I rode down into a spectacular fjord with steep mountains rising up out of the fjord's northern side. I could make out the road snaking in and out of tunnels along the southern side. I couldn't see a sandy beach so pushed on.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDgeQnoWAAAsZKi?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Arriving at Senja" /><figcaption>Arriving at Senja</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Around the headland and still no sandy beach you could camp on. However there was a tunnel heading directly into the mountains. Was this the steep tunnel Daniel had warned of? I stuffed myself with a few Coop extra value fish cakes for sustenance and headed in. It turned out to be fairly flat and it emerged around the corner at the village - about six houses - of Ersfjord. Here was a sandy beach in a lovely cove. There was even a little car park with a toilet block. That doesn't do it justice. It was a huge golden toilet block with a large diamond shaped sky light giving the user glorious views of the sky.</p>

				<p>There was already a school group camped at one end of the beach so I gave them some space and went a bit further along. As the evening progressed the weather improved and I decided to have a quick dip in the Atlantic. It was cold but the sun was there to warm me up afterwards. It was a perfect evening.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017016.html">Resting in Troms&oslash;</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-28T23:59+0100" datetime="2017-06-28T23:59+0100">Wednesday 28th Jun 2017 (22:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Today was a rest day. As seems to have become the norm in big cities, I did my laundry. Actually, as it cost &pound;10 to use the washing machine and dryer, I hand washed things and tried to use the sun to dry them. I ate.</p>
				
				<p>In the early evening I headed back over the bridge to to Troms&oslash; Bike Kitchen. It is a workshop a bit like the Pedaller's Arms in Leeds so they provide tools and space and you get on with it. There I met Carl (Norwegian), Alice (Italian) and Bo (Norwegian with a Scottish accent). They were very welcoming and told me they'd only been open a short time. I adjusted my gears and brakes.</p>

				<p>Back at the campsite I met Christophe the French cyclist again. He had reached Nordkapp and had taken the Hurtigruten back to Troms&oslash;. He donated his camping gas to me as he couldn't take it on the flight. How nice to meet someone again.</p>
				
				<p>I made myself a big plate of pasta with tuna and tomato sauce along with some spinach (today's luxury buy) with garlic. The tomato was kindly donated by Paolo and Simon who I'd chatted to in English/Italian at the tent area. Grazie Paolo! After dinner Paolo offered me a proper Italian coffee. I joined him, Simon, Stephenie and Arnold (the latter two were from The Netherlands). We chatted into the midnight sun about Europe, the environment, travel and art (Stephenie is an accomplished artist).</p>

				<p>I saw the midnight sun for the first time (it has been cloudy) and we wished each other "bonna notte".</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-27T21:14+0100" datetime="2017-06-27T21:14+0100">Tuesday 27th Jun 2017 (20:14 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I was up early.  The Norwegian cyclist had told me to catch the ferry before 11am as there was no service over lunchtime. It was raining though so I had to pack up a wet tent. Again. Something my dad told me never to do when I was a kid. I also skipped making breakfast because of the rain and a need to make the ferry.</p>
				
				<p>I was about halfway between ferries so only had 10km to go. It felt longer on my knees. As I rounded the headland to the main fjord I saw the ferry making its way across. It was a race. I made it to the harbour at Svensby just as the ferry was docking at about 9.25am.</p>
				
				<p>Like yesterday, this ferry was also free. Bonus! It was a shorter trip and brought me to a harbour without any real village attached which was slightly odd. I went a few kilometres then decided I needed breakfast. Two fried eggs, porridge, banana, tea and trail mix helped fill an empty stomach.</p>
				
				<p>After the initial rain, the day stayed largely dry despite threatening clouds. I made good progress along the quiet road then had to join the much busier E8 for a few kilometres before a very welcome sign took me off on a quieter road.</p>
				
				<p>At Troms&oslash; I made my way across the big bridge to hunt for the tourist information office. On the way there I met Pat and Geoff who were from Australia's Sunshine Coast. They'd been cycling in Iceland and were about to cycle down from Nordkapp. They asked about the conditions.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDVGlnvXYAIPjoq?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Pat and Geoff" /><figcaption>Pat and Geoff</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At the tourist information office I made use of the WiFi to check my email. I had some emails from Sheena who I'd met on top of a hill the other day. By happy coincidence her emails told me to go to the tourist information office and speak to Sonja. Here I was! Sonja told me she had something for me. It turned out Sheena had put together a care package for me full of food. What a lovely surprise. Thanks again Sheena and Alistair.</p>
				
				<p>Sonja gave me maps for the route to the bottom of Lofoten and told me about the ferry prices. Eek. I could save a bit by buying a Troms&oslash; travel card. Perhaps I can pass it on to a cyclist heading north once I'm out of range. Sonja also checked local accommodation for me. I decided I was going to have a proper rest day. My plan to have one in Alta had been scuppered by several hours of walking with a broken bike. I opted for a campsite as it was the cheapest. Sonja very kindly sent me on my way with some extra goodies.</p>

				<p>The campsite is nice. I made use of the kitchen. I can have a shower after three days wild camping. Tomorrow I may try to use the sauna and at least rinse my clothes whilst I give my knees some rest. I have a long way to go.</p>
