				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-06T21:10+0100 " datetime="2017-07-06T21:10+0100 ">Thursday 06th Jul 2017 (20:10 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I woke to the pitter patter of rain on my tent. Again. It eased a bit by about 8.30 so I put it away wet again but without me getting too wet. Except for my feet. Will they ever be allowed to be dry for a full day?</p>
				
				<p>It was a steep climb to start the day over to Tjong then around Tjongsfjorden and through the 3.2 km long Straumdaltunnelen which rose for 2 km before flattening off. As I sped down to Jektvika I was worried by a wave of vehicles. Had I missed the ferry? I needn't have worried. It turned out I'd timed it perfectly again. This ferry cost 66 krones as it was an hour long trip. However it was also special. It would take me over the Arctic Circle. The start of the ride was sunny but, as we approached the point in question, the rain set in as if to make a point that I may be leaving the Arctic but that didn't mean sunshine and clear skies. This is the Atlantic coast after all.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry deposited me at Killboghamn. Once again this turned out to consist of nothing but the ferry terminal. I asked a lady if there were any shops for food supplies. She said "one mile along on the right". It was a long one mile. It felt more like 10. This part of the coast seems more remote. Although there are frequent "villages" they are mostly just a few spread out houses. Gone are the frequent Coops I was used to up north. My phone is now on "Edge" which also suggests there aren't enough people to justify the expense of upgrading the network. That makes the Internet achingly slow.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped short of Stoke&aring;gen at a cafe and had a 45 krones coffee and cake. I then started around a huge fjord that just kept going. At least I was staying just ahead of the rain along the northern side. But I could see the southern side seemed to be in permanent rain. I imagine the mountains were the cause. That was to come. As I discovered, as well as rain, this southern side presented a big climb. Up and up it went. At 240m I saw a bicycle and stopped. It was Claudia from yesterday. She was huddled by her bike eating some food she'd cooked. She said the locals at the end of the fjord complained about the rain from the mountain.</p>
				
				<p>I carried on in the hope that crossing over the summit would take me out of the rain. The summit of the road was at 340 metres with an annoying drop of about 70 metres before a climb back to 320 metres. As I'd hoped, the rain lessened over the top. It was only about 15 km to Nesna for the next ferry but I'd done enough so stopped at 285 metres in a picnic spot with a WC and a stunning view out to the Atlantic.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-05T21:00+0100 " datetime="2017-07-05T21:00+0100 ">Wednesday 05th Jul 2017 (20:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Another day putting away a wet tent. I put it inside a plastic bag to stop it making my sleeping bag and liner wet during the day in my pannier. Having camped at altitude (relative) I had a downhill section to start the day. The rain was cold. My feet were wet from putting on my shoes. It feels as though my feet have barely been dry since I started. I wonder if I'm getting trenchfoot. </p>
				
				<p>I passed a few pairs of cyclists going in the opposite direction. None stopped. I didn't blame them. The rain and hills were not too conducive to chatting. However, at a spectacular viewpoint surrounded by sculpted mountains, two cyclists had stopped. I stopped. They were a couple from Sweden. We talked about the rain. They said there would be better weather in Sweden. They noticed my Ikea bag. We talked about the tunnel ahead. They didn't want to go through it and were hoping for an alternative. I realised the alternative was a 300m climb so I went through it.</p>
				
				<p>At the other end of the tunnel was better weather and a picnic spot with a toilet. I really appreciate all the people who clean and maintain tourist toilets. I've made use of quite a few along the way. I had second breakfast and a nice cup of tea.</p>
				
				<p>The weather was better on this 
				section of the coast. My shoes 
				started to dry. The scenery was 
				beautiful. I made it to &Oslash;rnes 
				in plenty of time for the ferry so 
				visited the Coop and the made myself 
				some fried egg sandwiches. On the 
				ferry I met Claudia from Germany who 
				was cycling, skiing, kayaking and 
				generally adventuring her way around 
				Norway. We talked with a retired 
				Norwegian policeman who seemed quite 
				taken with our travels.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry ended at Vassdalsvik which turned out just to be a ferry terminal and little else. I said goodbye to Claudia and headed on. Around into the next fjord provided some beautiful views as I stayed on the edge of the sun and rain. I was treated to a rainbow against the northern side of the fjord. The southern side of the fjord involved a bit more of a climb before heading down to Fur&oslash;y. I had been going to stop at the campsite here but my timing was impeccable and the ferry had just unloaded. I asked the ticket seller if there was anywhere to camp on the next section. She said there was a lake named Agvatnet. That settled it. I took the ferry to &Aring;gskardet and headed up to the lake.</p>
				
				<p>The lake had spectacular views of mountains ahead. I put my tent up whilst it was dry and got talking to a group of Italians who were in three camper vans. I got to dust off my patchy Italian. They'd been fishing and I watched as they filleted the cod they'd caught. They were covering them in salt to preserve them and take them home. They said they'd last up to two years. The shared their beer and breadsticks with me. It is amazing what a difference it makes to be able to talk to people, in however limited a fashion, in their own language.</p>
				
				<p>My tent dried in the evening sunshine. After I'd had a spinach soup and egg sandwich it started to rain again. I retired to my tent for the night.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-04T21:00+0100 " datetime="2017-07-04T21:00+0100 ">Tuesday 04th Jul 2017 (20:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I arrived at Bod&oslash; in the early hours. Thankfully the ferry terminal had an indoor waiting area. I pushed together three chairs and tried to sleep. I woke around 9am and headed for the bike shop. It wasn't yet officially open but the mechanic, who didn't speak English, got to work on my bike and sorted out the gears for me. I'd now have the full 24 instead of 12 and wouldn't be hurting my thumb.</p>
				
				<p>With my bike back to tip top condition, I went into town. The tourist map advertised a pizza restaurant with an all-you-can-eat pizza and salad buffet lunch for 129 krones. Perfect. I spent a couple of hours eating.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, in the early afternoon I was off. Bod&oslash; has a pretty good bike lane out of the city. By mid afternoon I reached Saltstramun where there is a "malstr&oslash;m" caused by the tidal water flowing through a narrow channel. It was clearly a popular tourist attraction and it seems there are power boat trips into the whirlpools.</p>
				
				<p>After a waffle and cocoa (I'm pushing the boat out today), I was back into the ups and downs of the fjord edges. I feel as though most of Norway exists in the narrow (but long) patch of land between the sea and the mountains. With sea levels rising, I wonder what fraction of the population will have to move upwards.</p>
				
				<p>I still needed to get my 80 km done for the day. At 70 km I was nearly calling it a day but persisted onwards. Then the rain set in. There was nowhere appropriate to stop for the night. Everything was too steep, too bumpy, or right on the edge of a cliff. I pushed on through a tunnel. That gave me a break from the rain. </p>
				
				<p>Out through another tunnel I suddenly halted as I noticed a big waterfall falling away to the right. Another cyclist, a Frenchman, had also stopped here to take a photo. I decided I would camp up stream a little but the French cyclist was heading back down to fjord-level to camp. He was tired of the coastal weather and had seen enough mountains. He said he might go into Sweden for a break. He sped off down the hill whilst I pitched my tent in the rain. At least the rain kept the mosquitos at bay. I slept to the sound of the river below me.</p>

				<p>I met the Dutch couple again at breakfast. Their names were Petra and Anne. They told me my lunch stop yesterday was near to a secret thing for cyclists. I'm not sure what the thing was but they were going to seek it out.</p>

				<p>I was off around 10.15 with shoes that were still disappointingly wet after yesterday despite me putting them in the drying room. My dorm mate from Corsica said he'd look out for me on the road whilst he was driving. I made good progress despite the westerly wind against me. Going around a big bay I met a group of Norwegian cyclists. They were cycling Lofoten.</p>

				<p>Near Lyngv&aelig;r I saw a sea eagle high overhead. Unfortunately it wasn't for getting any lower preferring to view things from afar. My route thankfully took me off the E10 Road onto the 815 which was quieter and on the eastern side of the island so was sheltered from the wind.</p>

				<p>I made it to Leknes just after 2pm after a surprise 110m hill. The cafes were too expensive (standard Norwegian prices) so I went to the Coop and made my own lunch out of town sheltering from the wind in a bus stop. I rode on over a pass down into the westerly wind and around a big fjord to Ramberg. The fjord had lovely sandy beaches but the weather wasn't really suitable to enjoy them. It looked as though the wind was bringing in some better weather. </p>

				<p>I caught up briefly with Victoria and Ewan from a few days ago. They'd seen Sheena and Alistair yesterday too. Shortly afterwards I caught up with Aris and Florence from Greece. They'd cycled from Nordkapp and were heading for the same ferry. Aris had built his own bike so it was "38% longer than most".</p>

				<p>Cycling on to Moskenes I passed drying cod's heads, beautiful mountains and pretty little sea side villages.</p>

				<p>I had to carry on past Moskenes another 4.5km to &Aring; (pronounced like the a in saw). It marks the end of the road in Lofoten. A friendly group of Norwegian motorcyclists took my photo for me.</p>

				<p>I had taken my time today as the plan was to get the 23.45 ferry. That way I don't have to stay anywhere tonight and can be bright and early for a visit to the bike shop in the morning. As I sailed away from Lofoten it gave me one parting gift; a dramatic view of the midnight sun.</p>
