				<p>I've now been on the road for the same length of time as cycling from San Francisco to Boston in 2014. I've done about 40% more distance.</p>
				
				<p>...a bit of a sweet tooth - I definitely have this on my long rides. <a href="https://t.co/TV1E3uHfGG"></a></p>
				
				<p>I just realised that I will also be visiting the northernmost, westernmost, and southernmost points of Spain.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-09-24T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-09-24T23:59+0200">Sunday 24th Sep 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I had an early start this morning to try to get some miles in before it got too hot. My first problem was that a bike route claimed on my map could only be accessed by steps. That wasn't going to happen. So I went back around to the road. Up it went so progress was slow.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/911953993483608065/pu/img/bL7UyFFVZ9cn5e9b.jpg" alt="landscape" title="I set off early this morning." /><figcaption>I set off early this morning.</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>There were plenty of Camino pilgrims already out walking the road so I passed quite a few. Then, as I was sailing down the other side: whooooosh. Air went from my rear tyre. I came to a stop to avoid damaging the wheel before all the air was out. Drat. I had a puncture. I removed my bags and took a look. A pilgrim gave me a hand getting the tyre off then carried on his way. The cheap French tyre has worn on the side. Probably my fault with badly positioned brakes. But it has gone a good distance in the past couple of weeks. I replaced the inner tube, tried to patch the tyre's wear with duct tape, and cautiously continued.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DKefKQKXoAETFde.jpg" alt="landscape" title="It's hilly around here." /><figcaption>It's hilly around here.</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I reached the top of the next hill and found a picnic area. I had a three fried egg sandwich. It was that sort of day.</p>
				
				<p>As I pressed on I heard a noise on each wheel rotation. That meant it wasn't pedal related (my left pedal has been making disconcerting noises recently). I looked. The inner tube was poking out of the tyre and rubbing on the brake pad. I adjusted the brake pad but knew I couldn't really use the brakes too much now. Google maps said I had a downhill, followed by another 170m hill, some relative flat, then another 170m hill. If they didn't have switch backs I might survive.</p>
				
				<p>I got over the first hill and down to Laredo where there was traffic due to the Sunday festivities. I stopped to see what was going on but as I set off again: whoooosh. Puncture two of the day.</p>
				
				<p>I did a puncture repair and really put lots of duct tape around the rim of the tyre. It looked ridiculous (don't do this at home, kids) but I had few options given everywhere was shut because it was Sunday. My best option was to head towards Santander where, in the morning, I'd have more chance of finding a good tyre. Preferably another Schwalbe marathon plus.</p>

				<p>I had a brief stop at a supermarket that was miraculously open and got two "chocolate triangle" pastries for a euro.</p>

				<p>As I rode the relatively flat road out towadds Santa&ntilde;o and on towards the next hill, I mused on the fact I'd not seen any branches of the bank Santander which is everywhere in the UK.</p>

				<p>I crossed the bridge near Somo. I was stopping every few km to restick to duct tape that was struggling in the 26C heat. Then, in Gajano, I had a new problem. My pannier rack broke. Double drat. The little bracket on the right-hand side had snapped. Whilst I was attempting a rough fix, a man from Parbayón offered that I could stay at his house.</p>

				<p>His name was Luis and he knows a good bike shop I can visit in the morning. Ignoring the warnings you get at primary school, I went off with this stranger in his car. I'll have to cycle back to where he gave me a lift from, in the morning, but I it'll be less than 20km.</p>
				
				<p>Luis said I can stay tomorrow and do laundry so it seems like the right time for a 'rest' day (I'll cycle what I missed plus fix bike so it won't be a proper rest).</p>

				<p>I had breakfast thanks to the kind French lady I met at the hostel last night. It was nice to have a high calorie pastry and an espresso. She told me she was visiting San Juan de Gaztelugatxe which she had wanted to do for years but was worried it was going to be very busy as it had been in a recent season of <em>Game Of Thrones</em>.</p>
				
				<p>I visited the little supermarket in Mundaka to get supplies. I need to make the best of my budget now that accommodation is more expensive.</p>

				<p>To start my morning I was given a 300+ metre hill to climb in the hot sun. At the top I saw the island the French lady had mentioned.</p>

				<p>Although I hadn't planned to - and didn't even know about it until this morning - I decided I would detour to visit. It certainly was popular. It took a while to climb down mostly because of the slow crowds. But it was good to visit and I even rang the church bell.</p>

				<p>After climbing back up I got back on my bike and headed down to Bakio where I stopped to have lunch by the beach. Lunch consisted of baguette, jambon cru, and some cake I'd bought earlier. There appeared to be some kind of surfing event or competition going on.</p>

				<p>After fuelling up in the shade, I began the climb up the next hill. It waa hard going in the heat of the sun. Thankfully I was able to frequently refill my water bottles at the regular water points; the Camino de Santiago route provides well for the walkers.</p>

				<p>When I had originally planned my route, back at home, I had been worried about navigating Bilbao. Yesterday I realised there was a Transporter Bridge that would save me going into Bilbao. Thanks to a couple of people on Twitter, I'd found out it ran regularly and should be inexpensive. The Transporter Bridge was really good value. It was only 70 cents to cross with a bike. It is fast and leaves every 8 minutes.</p>

				<p>I have had trouble finding non-extortionate camping sites. They are getting more expensive as I go along the coast.</p>
				
				<p>In Pobeña I stopped to look at my phone to track down a site. A Spanish couple gestured to my left and said albergue.</p>
				
				<p>So, thanks to a lack of any affordable options 20-30 km further on, I finished today much earlier than normal.</p>
				
				<p>The price at the albergue is by donation. That helps my stretched budget.</p>
				
				<p>It seems I caused confusion at the Albergue. You can only use the albergue if you have a Camino passport. The nice people sorted me out with one.</p>
				
				<p>I now have to get it stamped every day. But apparently that can be done in shops and pubs as well as albergues.</p>
