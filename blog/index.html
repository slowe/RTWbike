				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015029.html">To Vienna</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-31T21:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-31T21:00:00+0200">Sunday 31st May 2015 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Packing up my tent I had to deal with ants crawling over all my stuff 
				again. I wish we could come to a peace negotiation. I headed off along 
				the pleasant EV6 into an impressive valley cut by the mighty river. The 
				EV6 goes along both banks at this point but I stuck to the south side 
				reasoning it would provide more shade for me and better lighting of the 
				north for photos. It was very pleasant and I stopped for breakfast at a 
				little cafe where I was the only customer early on a Sunday morning. 
				Enjoyable miles took me to Ybbs where there were lots of signs along the 
				trail advertising a bicycle museum. Unfortunately for me, and the other 
				cyclists who'd had their interest piqued, it was shut on a Sunday. If 
				only I'd been a day earlier like Stevens.</p>
				
				<p>Onwards to Melk and the 
				impressive monastery Stevens had mentioned. It certainly was big. Here I 
				had to deal with clueless tourists pouring out of a Viking River Cruise 
				boat into the cycle path. Then I got surrounded by a similarly unaware 
				group of perhaps 20 touring cyclists all wearing matching green Lycra. 
				In trying to get away from them I nearly came off my bike. In Melk I 
				enquired at the tourist information about the oldest barbers to see if I 
				could find where Thomas had a shave. The lady was confused telling me 
				they would be shut. I said it didn't matter. I think she preferred the 
				sort of questions from the cruise ship tourists.</p>
				
				<p>After a nice ice cream and a look around, with a heavy heart I left the flat and pretty EV6 to head across country. Unlike the previous 
				times though this looked not as hilly. That was true in parts. The cycle 
				routes tended to follow the non-hypotenuse sides of triangles with the 
				motorway taking the direct route. I reached Neulengbach where Thomas had 
				stayed on the Saturday night. It didn't look to have much in the way of 
				accommodation and a call to a youth hostel in Vienna indicated their 
				reception was 24 hours. I decided I'd press on and catch up. The only 
				drawback was that Google Maps should a huge hill. A well placed petrol 
				station supplied me with juice as I'd exhausted all my liquid reserves. 
				The hill was big but the downhill was glorious and long. It lasted about 
				15 miles to Vienna several miles of which I stayed on the tail of a guy 
				on a road bike to his surprise.</p>
				
				<p>As I got into the city I found a river side bike path for a few miles. In the city, loads of people were on bikes and there were plenty of bike lanes. I got freaked out by polite motorists giving way when bike lanes crossed roads. UK drivers wouldn't dream of doing that; at least not universally enough to trust that they would. The youth hostel was all the way across the city so it was getting dark as I got there. I'd broken the Imperial century, was exhausted, famished, but had at least caught up with Thomas. And he was giving me a few days off to recover.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015028.html">Back to the Danube</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-30T21:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-30T21:00:00+0200">Saturday 30th May 2015 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I took full advantage of loading up my stomach at breakfast and got an 
				earlyish start. The temperatures were getting hotter and it was blue 
				skies. I was going to melt.</p>
				
				<p>On the way out of Wels I randomly discovered Juipter which meant I was on another planet path. There was lots of nice bike trail that thankfully became wooded giving me some shade. Unfortunately the trail ended near Traun and my GPS decided the bike trails cut the corner off the bend of the river. Of course that meant hills. These weren't too bad and I even had some forest cover at some point. Down the other side to the Danube and I reunited with the Eurovelo 6. I decided to have a rest and a banana at one nice spot with a good view along the river. There was a bench but it was occupied by two other touring cyclists. I must have looked longingly at it because the lady asked if I wanted to sit down. She asked in English! The couple turned out to bevJane and John from Swansea who were cycling to Vienna along the Danube. They'd been in Blaubeuren and Ulm but had sensibly stuck with the river rather than strike a direct line over the hills as Stevens had. It was really nice to have a conversation and I ended up cycling with them to Wallsee. Unfortunately that meant I'd gone 3 miles beyond Strengberg so I had to head backwards. There followed a bit of cursing of Stevens as I realised Strengberg was up a big hill. Seriously Thomas, why not stay in the flat of the Danube valley?</p>
				
				<p>The town was closed. Even the shop only did half day trading on a Saturday so it was back down the hill (couldn't get the full benefits due to a blind bend) and back up the other side to Well see. I decided to press on back to the EV6. Reaching Ardagger I saw one of the motorhome parks that they had in France - basically a bit of ground provided by the village with some electrical hook up points and a toilet block. This one had some grass though so being braver I asked a motorhomer if I could camp. They said "why not? give it a go" so I did. I boiled up some water and made tea and minestrone as the church bells rang out. The Morrison's Cafe milk sachets I've been carrying proved useful.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015027.html">Imperial century</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-29T21:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-29T21:00:00+0200">Friday 29th May 2015 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>After leaving the Gasthaus I went to find toilet and discovered a huge 
				car park, under kapellplatz, built in 1983. I left Altoetting and headed 
				for the Inn river trail again. It was nice to be on it so early and I 
				cheerily said "hallo" to those on bikes going in the opposite direction. 
				I passed through Marktl where the last pope - the one who resigned - had 
				been born. At Simbach am Inn I headed into the town centre to see what 
				was there. Not a lot it turned out except for some free WiFi in the main 
				square and I discovered it was twinned with Skipton in North Yorkshire. 
				Time was moving on and so should I. It was time to cross the river into 
				Austria. Unlike in Stevens's day there is no longer a border guard (yay 
				for Shengen) and I didn't have to change my currency. I joined the 
				Austrian version of the Inn river bike trail which started off quite 
				rough but improved. As I left the environs of the Inn I spotted an 
				impressive tree house complete with metal shutters on the window. At 
				Altheim I stopped for lunch like Stevens but a day late due to my phone 
				trouble. It was a nice outside beer garden in the main street and I 
				chose it partly because a crew of elderly cyclists were dining there 
				already.</p>
				
				<p>I left Altheim at 2pm already worried I'd been taking things too slow. Especially as Stevens wrote about an "aggravatingly hilly" road ahead. As he hardly noted the giant hill near Oppenau that had me worried.</p>
				
				<p>After a few days of relative flatness it did indeed get more hilly. This is mostly because Stevens kept a pretty direct line east rather than following the curve of the river. I got pretty exhausted just before Haag am Haustruck due to a big climb. It did result it a stunning view to the north and gave me a freewheel down into Haag which I managed to reach by 5pm. That still left me 24 hours behind. After loading up on drinks and sweets at the shop I decided to press on the extra miles to Lambach. Once there I realised it was another 10 or so miles to Eels where there was a youth hostel. There website and the Wels website didn't mention their reception hours so I rang up. They said they spoke "a little English" but that phrase was actually the extent of it so I still didn't know. I decided to push on following the Train river trail. I pushed hard despite still being exhausted from the hills. I arrived at 7.17pm to discover a sign on their door saying their hours were 5-7pm! Using the world's slowest 3G I spent an hour trying to find an alternative in the fading light. Eventually I had to give in and stay at the cheapest hotel I could find. Two days budget gone on one night. I took the opportunity to at least rinse my most smelly clothes from the day in the sink. For dinner I had to make do with bread and cheese left over from Munich washed down with Nutella.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015026.html">Phone troubles</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-28T18:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-28T18:00:00+0200">Thursday 28th May 2015 (16:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I was up early as Franz was going to pick me up at 8am. My phone alarm 
				went off at the usual time of 7.30 and the only way to stop the noise 
				was to mute the sound with the volume buttons. After breakfast Franz 
				arrived and we went to his portacabin office at the hydro plant where I 
				tried to find a solution. The best the manufacturer - Sony - could 
				suggest was that I send it to them and they may fix it in 5-7 days from 
				arrival. They couldn't tell me how much it would cost and couldn't 
				advise on how I might get it fixed by Sony Germany. Useless. So Franz 
				took me to an electrical store where they also said it could take a 
				week. The only practical solution was for me to buy a new phone. I got 
				an 86 euro basic model then Franz drove me back to the hotel as he had 
				to drive to Vienna. Huge thanks to Franz for being so calming and 
				helpful.</p>
				
				<p>I spent the morning and afternoon wandering around Altoetting failing to find free WiFi that works so I could update the phone software. I currently have a half functioning phone which is an improvement at least. I will now catch up on sleep and try to get an early start tomorrow to catch up on the day's cycling I've missed.</p>
