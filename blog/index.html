				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-22T22:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-22T22:00:00+PDT">Thursday 22nd May 2014 (22:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I was up early with a night undisturbed by moose (mooses?). I initially followed the WY30 for a short distance before my GPS indicated a track on the left. There didn't really seem to be one. I hesitated. Then I saw a barbed wire fence and a gate section. Back home I'd have been very wary of going into land as a farmer would be out waving a shotgun. However, I'd been told that most of the land in Wyoming was owned by the state and people were allowed to use the tracks. Feeling brave I went through it. </p>
				
				<p>The next few miles were tough going as it wasn't much of a track and what there was had a covering of sand meaning I had to push. My laden bike will not pedal through sand. Eventually, as I climbed up onto some Buttes, the sand lessened and I was able to pedal. Along the top of the Buttes I skimmed with great views in most directions.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14326358043"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3725/14326358043_8fa45bb902_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Railroad views from the top of the Buttes" /></a><figcaption>Railroad views from the top of the Buttes</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I could see smoke from a chemical plant towards the east and the railroad to the north. The track followed the top of the Buttes towards the railroad below then turned right to follow it. I went over a crossing and along the side of the railroad to the chemical works. Here was a sign saying "private railroad crossing" which was OK by me as I wasn't crossing it. There was a chemical smell in the air so I used my buff to cover my nose and mouth. I dread to think what I was breathing in at this remote site. There were lots of trains - parked and moving - that blocked my view from the chemical works. I felt that was a good thing.</p>
				
				<p>At this point I saw my first passenger train since California. I waved at the passengers peering down at me through their tinted windows. I wonder what they made of seeing a cyclist out here in the middle-of-nowhere. Eventually the track needed to cross the railroad at a "private railroad crossing". As my only other alternative was to swim across the river or go the many miles back to the WY30, I ignored the "private" sign. I suspect it was only to cover them against being sued if I had an accident. Further along I waved at some railroad workers out fixing the lines. They waved back.</p>
				
				<p>I wasn't overly comfortable on this frontage road and was glad when I found an off ramp to <em>Byron Road</em>. I ignored my planned route along the side of the railroad in favour of a paved road after hours of sand and dirt. Stevens was a hardy soul.</p>
				
				<p>Back to and over the I-80 I had a long freewheel downhill sandwiched between the freeway and the railroad towards <em>Green River</em>. As I approached the outskirts of the town I was following the river down into the dramatic canyon it had carved. Eons of geological time was exposed for all to see in the layers of rock. I stopped at a 50s diner and, after filling up on calories, I visited the town museum. They had quite a few exhibits (and school parties) and it was good to see them tackling issues such as the massacre of Chinese workers in 1885. It is shameful how badly treated non-Europeans were in the Wild West and the Chinese emigrants didn't even officially count as population.</p>

				<p>From Green River I spotted the Old Lincoln Highway so aimed for that rather than the I-80. This involved a very steep sandy track uphill which I had to walk. It gave me a closer experience to that of Stevens. Under the I-80 and to the cemetary then a very hilly and poor dirt track to join the equally poor Old Lincoln Highway. Thankfully nobody really uses it as I had to weave all over the road to avoid huge holes. I passed more house-like buildings that weren't habitation but some kind of service buildings for gas pipes or other industry. They give the impression of being in a populated landscape when you aren't.</p>

				<p>A couple of miles from <em>Rock Springs</em> the Old Lincoln Highway turned into a paved road and made a pleasant ride into town. Tonight I was staying with a guy named Rick who met me on his fold up bike. At his apartment he gave me some chicken and a baked potato - the first real potato I'd had in weeks. Rick had several bikes. He said:</p>
				
				<p><blockquote>"The optimum number of bikes is n + 1 where n is how many you have."</blockquote></p>
				
				<p>Rick had cycled across the United States in around 36 days on the southern route which makes my 100 day long northern route seem a bit lazy. However, even his time seemed leisurely compared to the fastest crossing of the US which was only 7 days 22 hours! Rick was an interesting guy with lots of cycling experience and a huge range of books in his library. We had a wide-ranging conversation covering everything from Russian politics to me trying to explain what the Eurovision Song Contest was without sounding delusional.</p>
				
				<p>Total distance so far: 1238 miles.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-21T21:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-21T21:00:00+PDT">Wednesday 21st May 2014 (21:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I was up bright and early but couldn't set off and there was condensation in my tent so I waited for the sun to dry it out. There had been another tent on the site during the night - it was the first other tent I've seen so far - but they'd arrived by car late and left early.</p>
				
				<p>A lady came over to talk to me from an RV. She was Pat from Louisiana and she was joined by Michael. We had a good chat. They'd just done a 10 day long rafting trip down the Grand Canyon and ther daughter lived in Wyoming. After chatting I finished packing and headed off. </p>

				<p>My GPS route took me on some dubious track that, in places, was too sandy for riding and, in other parts, too bumpy to get any speed on. I got to see my first "Buttes". I'd only ever seen the word written down so had imagined it was pronounced "butts" but it turned out they are "b-you-tes". Not quite as amusing to a childish mind.</p>

				<p>I hit the <em>Country Road</em> and it wasn't much better for the first couple of miles. It was unpaved and suffered from the annoying ruts that (washboarding) that feel like they will shake my bike to pieces. Having been singing since the Sierra Nevadas (initially to ward off bears but now it was a habit), the road name inspired me to burst into some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN86d0CdgHQ">John Denver</a> replacing "West Virginia" with "West Wyoming". Thankfully there was nobody around to hear me.</p>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/000055.shtml">Stevens had specifically mentioned</a> <em>Church Buttes</em> which he'd seen a couple of miles to the south of the railroad. Being on the road, I actually went right by them.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14306148985"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2927/14306148985_c97c52b349_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Church Buttes" /></a><figcaption>Church Buttes</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>My road turned back into the Lincoln Highway and it took me through gas fields with solar powered tanks dotted around the landscape making it look populated although there wasn't a soul to be seen.</p>
				
				<p>At a gas works the road had been sprayed with magnesium chloride and the dampness turned the sand/gravel into the horrible aggregate filled mud I'd had before. A few miles later I had to get off the road to avoid the sprayer. The spraying was to stop dust but was sticking to my bike and was not pleasant.</p>

				<p>I turned up the road to remote Granger, passed the new elementary school, and into the town. Once again a building with several dogs errupted in a barking frenzy at my approach. One little dog wasn't chained or fenced in and it ran right up to me barking wildly. When I bent down to see if it would be petted it ran off with its tail between its legs. </p>
				
				<p>I popped into the Town Hall (although it was more like a glorified porta-cabin) and talked to Vivian. She'd lived in Wyoming for 47 years and knew a little about Granger even though she actually lived in Green River. Granger was the meeting of two railroad lines and two rivers. It has a Pony Express station. I'd arrived in their 100th anniversary since been incorporated as a town. Their old school building was to become a community centre and Vivian's office would soon be moving in there. The current Town Hall would go back to being a house.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14304261412"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5531/14304261412_af27e5fcfb_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Granger Town Hall" /></a><figcaption>Granger Town Hall</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>Vivian told me I could camp in the park and that she'd tell the police officer when he called in. Around the corner was the Granger branch library which had a suprising number of books for a town with a population of a little over 100. They also had internet connected computers. I chatted to Felicia, the librarian, whose kids were on the computers. She mentioned there was a man on a horse with a flag riding across the country from Oregon and she was following him on Facebook. It seems the West is Facebook country. I am yet to meet anyone on Twitter.</p>
				
				<p>I found the park at the edge of the town (or hamlet). For dinner I went to the <em>Antelope Crossing Pub</em> run by Jessica. At the bar was the lady from the Post Office (I'd sent a postcard to my oldest friend from the town as it shared his surname) and Vern. Vern was one of the last state trappers and had a Thomas Stevens-style moustache. He was quite wiry and had a twinkly in his eye. He'd been trapping for 40 years and had largely taught himself. He caught all sorts of animals across a big area and lamented that youngsters in training wanted to be told how to do everything and get paid. I don't know. Young people of today with their demands!</p>
				
				<p>I was after food so I ordered a calzone from the bar menu and Vern was so convinced that I'd like it he said he'd pay for it if I didn't. We were joined by Tammy who ordered a long drink that I'm sure had whiskey in it. Vern seemed to be nursing a whiskey too. Stevens had described Granger as having:</p>
				
				<p><blockquote>"plenty of whiskey, but no customers"</blockquote></p>
				
				<p>It looked as though things had improved slightly since Stevens' day. Jessica was originally from California and had moved here when she got married. Between the four of us we had quite a conversation.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119673850"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3826/14119673850_75e0139d5b_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Tammy and Jessica" /></a><figcaption>Tammy and Jessica</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I should mention the calzone. It was huge! Great for a long distance cyclist. I had three-quarters of it and Jessica wrapped the remainder for me. I had a blackberry bear from Boston mostly because of the name - <em>Fat Tire</em>. Tammy said she'd get the lady that locks the toilets in the park to leave them open for me and, an hour or so later when I was in my tent, a car pulled up and the lady unlocked the gents for me. I'd met about 8% of the population now. As she jumped back into her SUV, she enigmatically warned:</p>
				
				<p><blockquote>"Don't let the moose step on you during the night."</blockquote></p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0044.html">Short day to Carter</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-20T18:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-20T18:00:00+PDT">Tuesday 20th May 2014 (18:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I'd lost faith in "tracks" in Wyoming so I decided to have anohter night at the KOA and just cycle to Carter and back. It was about 10 miles away over some hills and it was odd to be on an unloaded bike after all this time.</p>
				
				<p>At Carter dogs started barking at me and I was glad to see they were behind a fence. I turned around and completed a loop back around to Lyman. In the town I saw a sandwich shop and <em>Valley Vision</em>. I'd recently lost a small screw from one arm of my glasses so this was perfect. I entertained the staff of Valley Vision with my trip and they fixed my glasses for me. After a pitta sandwich and peanut butter shake I went to the gas station to pick up some supplies. The lady at the counter said she thought I had a cute accent! That is the first time anyone has ever said that to me.</p>
				
				<p>Back at the KOA I did laundry and rested.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0043.html">Roaming in Wyoming</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-19T20:58:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-19T20:58:00+PDT">Monday 19th May 2014 (20:58 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I headed back towards town then south under the I-80. I stopped at the Forest Service Ranger Station to ask about the road to Piedmont. Apparently it was clear of snow but was dirt/gravel. </p>
				
				<p>I was a month into my phone service so had to call their automated line for my sim card renewal. <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/468406978557931521">It wanted my zip code</a>. It really wanted a zip code. It eventually realised I didn't have one and put me through to a real person who could cope with non-Americans.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119543097"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5505/14119543097_403a1da6f9_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Towards the Uintah Mountains" /></a><figcaption>Towards the Uintah Mountains</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I headed to Hilliard and stopped at the historic markers. To a little beyond a reservoir the road was paved but it then turned to gravel/dirt. For the next few miles the road passed between occasional buildings. It wound its way around the landscape following some of the old railroad grade - the railroad had later been shortened by 10 miles when they built two tunnels so this section had been abandoned after Stevens' time.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119468040"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3797/14119468040_c9e4d345ff_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Road towards Piedmont" /></a><figcaption>Road towards Piedmont</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At Piedmont - named by two Italian women - I saw some old, broken down, buildings but wasn't sure of their age. There were three charcoal kilns and I had lunch there. Apparently Calamity Jane had lived in Piedmont and Butch Cassidy had left from here to rob a bank.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119434708"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5079/14119434708_0c15d8b84e_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Piedmont" /></a><figcaption>Piedmont</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>The road curved around to meet the I-80 again and I saw the only sheep I'd seen in America. They didn't seem to know what to do with a cyclist. I baaed at them but they may not have recognised my British vowel sounds.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119484550"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3807/14119484550_02bf44eaca_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Sheep crossing" /></a><figcaption>Sheep crossing</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I stayed on frontage road (marked with the Old Lincoln Highway "L") along the side of the freeway up a steep, long hill onto the top of a flat mountain. Most of the hills around here look like they've had the tops sliced off. It seems to be that the tops were originally a flat plain that has slowly eroded away. Up on this particular flat-topped hill was a huge wind farm and my road went between the turbines.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119570457"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5569/14119570457_344375832e_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Wind power" /></a><figcaption>Wind power</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I stopped for a rest (and some more Swedish Fish) at the interstate services. A man asked me if I was from California! All through California people thought I was Australian and now someone thought my accent was from California. People seem really bad at placing accents here.</p>
				
				<p>Leaving the services I failed to find the frontage road marked on Open Street Map - the first time it had failed me. At the next intersection I did find a frontage road but it then headed off in the wrong direction leaving me separated from the freeway by a huge carpark and a five foot tall barbed wire fence. I wasn't going backwards so I scaled the fence with my bike. I wasn't sure what the carpark was doing in the middle of nowhere. I'm sure Wyoming folk have their reasons.</p>
				
				<p>There was a fine road into Fort Bridger where I paid the $4 to visit the old trading post where Stevens had stayed. I had a chat with the young woman on the desk who had done a degree in history and was being an intern for the summer. I bought a "sasparilla" mostly because it was something I'd always heard mentioned in cowboy films so wanted to know what it tasted like. It was a tiny bit like a Dandelion & Burdock. I found a house built in 1884 and asked the lady there if she knew which month it was built in as Stevens may have seen it. She wasn't sure but we then talked about my trip.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119437199"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5501/14119437199_0ee5d52fa3_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Fort Bridger" /></a><figcaption>Fort Bridger</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Leaving the museum at closing time I headed up to Lyman, through the town and to the KOA ("Kampground of America") where I booked in. I asked the guy at the desk - Reagan - about my next stop (Carter) but he wasn't from Wyoming so didn't know. Later his boss came over and said there were only a few houses there. </p>
				
				<p>Checking my GPS I saw I'd climbed back up to an altitude of 6548 ft which is 1.5 times that of Ben Nevis. I was going to be higher than the entire British Isles throughout Wyoming.</p>
