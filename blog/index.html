				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-09T23:00+0100" datetime="2017-07-09T23:00+0100">Sunday 09th Jul 2017 (22:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I awoke to rain. It had rained all through the night. I tried waiting for it to stop but who knew when that would be? I packed everything up inside as best as I could. Some water had got in via the old floor of my tent. As I finally emerged into the light rain I was mobbed by the midges. The sooner I left here the better. A wet tent was packed up.</p>

				<p>I was now following the route of the Dutch couple so left the 17 and National Cycle Route 1 to take smaller roads to the ferry at Hofles. on the way I briefly chatted to a German man walking Norway. Traffic and rain meant I didn't want to hold him up. Further on I met Rudi and Ava from Switzerland cycling from Trondheim to Troms&oslash;.</p>

				<p>Once through Kolvereid the rain 
				stopped and it seemed quicker.
				Somehow I ended up racing the ferry again and got to Hofles just before they had started loading. It cost 48 krones to travel south to L&uuml;nd. During the crossing the sun finally came out. I had feared I'd be stuck getting wetter and wetter for days. At L&uuml;nd, rather than cycle off, I took over a picnic bench to have a belated lunch and to finally dry the clothes I'd rinsed at the campsite two days ago. After a double fried egg sandwich, I treated myself to an ice-cream for 26 krones at the cafe as it was one of the few places to have been open today.</p>

				<p>The next ferry arrived and I waited for all the traffic to speed off before setting off myself. It was nice to be out of the rain but now I needed sun cream and had to take layers off due to the heat. The route headed up a 120 metre hill. Near the top I had a scramble up some rocks and got a glorious view in two directions. I hadn't gone as far as I'd planned but I resolved to camp here tonight. There was only the tricky matter of getting tent pegs in. Then my nemesis returned. No, not the rain, the midges! I retreated into my tent as the only midge-free place. I was denied the enjoyment of the view.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017026.html">And then the rain set in </a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-08T23:00+0100 " datetime="2017-07-08T23:00+0100 ">Saturday 08th Jul 2017 (22:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>There had been rain overnight so the clothes I'd left out to dry hadn't. They got put in a plastic bag with the hope to dry them this evening. I set off late to ride the 17 kilometres to Annualsv&acirc;gan. A few kilometres before the harbour I ended up racing the ferry again. I got there just before the ferry. But, it turns out that on a Saturday there are fewer services so it sat there for over an hour.</p>
				
				<p>Over the water I arrived in Horn and cycled on to Br&oslash;nn&oslash;ysund. I visited the tourist information office then the shopping centre where I bought neoprene gloves and waterproof overshoes. I had a panic as I realised my GPS was missing. I retraced my steps and found it in the tourist information office. Phew.</p>
				
				<p>I started to go to the Torghatten; the mountain with a hole through the middle. Legend tells of eight sisters. A horseman saw them and had fallen in love with the oldest. He was a misogynist so decided to capture her. Thankfully she was able to out-run him. But there is nothing as bad as a man spurned and he decided that he would kill her instead. He fired an arrow at her. The troll king had been watching and threw his hat in the way. The sun then rose turning everything to stone. Torghatten was the troll's hat. However, part way there I saw the skies to the south. They looked dark. I turned around and headed back to the 17. Then the rain set in. I donned my new gloves and overshoes. I still got wet.</p>
				
				<p>I rode hard through the rain for the 40 kilometres to Vennesund. I arrived just in time for the ferry which was in the process of unloading. A short trip over to Holm and I rode a bit further along the road. Where to stop? Finding a flat spot was hard. The first I found was swarming with flies. I pressed on around a fjord and up a mountain. I found a roughly flat spot and decided I'd done enough for today. Within a couple of minutes I was swarmed by flies and midges. I quickly dug out the head net I had for just such an occasion. They are just as annoying as Scottish midges. I carefully cooked dinner inside my tent to escape the rain and midges. It kept raining.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017025.html">Beautiful day </a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-07T20:10+0100 " datetime="2017-07-07T20:10+0100 ">Friday 07th Jul 2017 (19:10 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I awoke to rain. I wasn't for stopping. I packed up as much as I could inside my tent to spend as little as I could outside. By the time I finished it had lessened but I was in cloud. Not to worry because I knew my route was about 16km down to the ferry at Nesna.</p>
				
				<p>The wet and hairpin bends of the past few days were wearing down my rear brakes. They'll need changing soon. But not now in the rain and cold. As I dropped west of the rainy mountain, the weather brightened. Via a food stop at the Coop (fishcakes!) I rolled into the ferry terminal to see Claudia already waiting. She'd camped where I'd seen her yesterday but she got an earlier start during a 15 minute gap in the rain. I made myself breakfast of fried egg sandwiches with ketchup, along with some hot chocolate. I had only just made the hot chocolate when the ferry arrived so casually walked my bike on-board holding it. As you do.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry ride to Levang was quite quick and the I rode with Claudia the 32 kilometres to Sandnessj&oslash;en. The weather was improving steadily and I got my solar panels out and strapped them over my Ikea bag. Despite a bit of traffic, it was enjoyable to be able to chat with someone.</p>
				
				<p>We crossed over the Helgelandbrau into Sandnessj&oslash;en. There we found the tourist information office both for information and the free WiFi. The office was part of a big, new, building that also housed a nice library, a cultural venue, and possibly a cafe. I didn't explore the cafe as I know I can't afford the prices in them. After posting photos I headed over to the Rema 1000 to get some food. Given the lack of supermarkets on the previous days, I bought more than I'd planned. So had Claudia. We ate some of it, sat in the sunshine, so that it would fit in our bags.</p>
				
				<p>We left along a smaller Road than the 17 but eventually had to climb a rather steep Road over a ridge. The view at the top was worth it though; we got to see the "seven sisters" which are a string of peaks in a row. The seventh, I assume, was the little bump on the end. A few kilometres further on I said goodbye to Claudia as she was camping here to walk the seven sisters tomorrow. I needed to get the ferry to Forvik today to keep on schedule for my flight. The next 24 kilometres were surprisingly flat compared to what I've experienced until now. With the sunshine and blue skies it was easy going. I was on time for the ferry again at Tj&oslash;travel and had a very pleasant hour-long ride to Forvik via the islands of Mindlandet and Tropical and a place on the mainland that was otherwise inaccessible.</p>
				
				<p>At Forvik I saw a sign for camping. After a little confusion over prices - I thought they wanted 100 krones for me to have a shower but it was just a deposit for the key to the shower - I pitched my tent. In the dry! Although my feet started the day wet, they were now dry too. What a beautiful day this had been.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017024.html">The biggest fjord yet </a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-06T21:10+0100 " datetime="2017-07-06T21:10+0100 ">Thursday 06th Jul 2017 (20:10 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I woke to the pitter patter of rain on my tent. Again. It eased a bit by about 8.30 so I put it away wet again but without me getting too wet. Except for my feet. Will they ever be allowed to be dry for a full day?</p>
				
				<p>It was a steep climb to start the day over to Tjong then around Tjongsfjorden and through the 3.2 km long Straumdaltunnelen which rose for 2 km before flattening off. As I sped down to Jektvika I was worried by a wave of vehicles. Had I missed the ferry? I needn't have worried. It turned out I'd timed it perfectly again. This ferry cost 66 krones as it was an hour long trip. However it was also special. It would take me over the Arctic Circle. The start of the ride was sunny but, as we approached the point in question, the rain set in as if to make a point that I may be leaving the Arctic but that didn't mean sunshine and clear skies. This is the Atlantic coast after all.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry deposited me at Killboghamn. Once again this turned out to consist of nothing but the ferry terminal. I asked a lady if there were any shops for food supplies. She said "one mile along on the right". It was a long one mile. It felt more like 10. This part of the coast seems more remote. Although there are frequent "villages" they are mostly just a few spread out houses. Gone are the frequent Coops I was used to up north. My phone is now on "Edge" which also suggests there aren't enough people to justify the expense of upgrading the network. That makes the Internet achingly slow.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped short of Stoke&aring;gen at a cafe and had a 45 krones coffee and cake. I then started around a huge fjord that just kept going. At least I was staying just ahead of the rain along the northern side. But I could see the southern side seemed to be in permanent rain. I imagine the mountains were the cause. That was to come. As I discovered, as well as rain, this southern side presented a big climb. Up and up it went. At 240m I saw a bicycle and stopped. It was Claudia from yesterday. She was huddled by her bike eating some food she'd cooked. She said the locals at the end of the fjord complained about the rain from the mountain.</p>
				
				<p>I carried on in the hope that crossing over the summit would take me out of the rain. The summit of the road was at 340 metres with an annoying drop of about 70 metres before a climb back to 320 metres. As I'd hoped, the rain lessened over the top. It was only about 15 km to Nesna for the next ferry but I'd done enough so stopped at 285 metres in a picnic spot with a WC and a stunning view out to the Atlantic.</p>
