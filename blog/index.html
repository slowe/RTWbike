				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-24T23:59+0100" datetime="2017-07-24T23:59+0100">Monday 24th Jul 2017 (22:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I made the most of having a hotel room by sleeping in and having a cooked breakfast. The ferry to John O Groats wasn't until the evening so I pottered about in Kirkwall buying dry bags for my clothes and having some tea in The Reel cafe before visiting St Magnus' cathedral. Then I rode south over the Churchill Barriers to the bottom of South Ronaldsay. Just a few hundred metres from the ferry terminal I could see there wasn't much there so followed a sign to a bistro where I was welcomed by Leona (from Lancashire). Leona was in training for an ultra marathon later in the year. I had a rather small (for a hungry cyclist) portion of rhubarb crumble with custard. After that I went back to the ferry terminal. </p>
				
				<p>Whilst making myself some sandwiches I was joined by Dave, from Coventry, who had spent the past few weeks cycling around the islands. We were joined by a touring cyclist from Lancaster, called Tony, and a Scottish family on bikes. By the time the ferry arrived there were even more bikes there. We had to lug our bikes up to the top deck because the tide was out at the other side and that is the level we'd be disembarking at. During the trip I chatted to Hanz and Maria from Austria. Amongst the usual conversation topics we also talked about Asterix and Obelix and the specific jokes in different languages.</p>
				
				<p>At John O Groats I disembarked and immediately was at the famous fingerpost. There I got talking to Jack and  who kindly took my picture for me.</p>
				
				<p>I opted to stay at the campsite where I met Dave and Tony again. After dinner, the three of us headed to the local pub to exchange stories of our trips. They were both really interesting with entirely different approaches to what they liked to do on their trips but both united in their appreciation of down jackets. It was a good evening. I was finally in Scotland.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-23T23:59+0100 " datetime="2017-07-23T23:59+0100 ">Sunday 23rd Jul 2017 (22:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>With a hotel breakfast in me, and sun in the sky, I decided to delay my full rest day and cycle around Orkney. Compared to Norway it was pretty flat although there was some wind from the north east.</p>
				
				<p>I cycled anticlockwise around the island, visiting a few neolithic sites. At Cuween Hill there was a 3000 year old burial chamber you could crawl into. There were some torches in a box outside but their batteries were low. I was glad to have my bike light with me.</p>
				
				<p>I had to battle the wind to get to the north east of the mainland but then things got easier with the wind partly behind me.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped at Birsay for a late lunch and then was too late to get into Skara Brae. A detour to Stromness to find a fish and chip shop turned up nothing. On the way back to Kirkwall I visited the stones of Stenness. You can hardly move in Orkney without tripping over a 3000, 4000, or 5000 year old structure. Fascinatingly, gaelic had never made it to Orkney. There had been the Picts and Norwegians so Orkadians see themselves as separate to Scotland. </p>
				
				<p>I cycled into Kirkwall by 8pm and went back to the fish and chip shop from last night.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-22T21:30+0100 " datetime="2017-07-22T21:30+0100 ">Saturday 22nd Jul 2017 (20:30 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I took the flight to Kirkwall. As it was operated by Logan Air,  I got a complementary Tunnocks caramel wafer. As we approached Kirkwall, the clouds cleared and we got some great views of the islands. On the ground we had to wait for the border check and then I tried to put my bike back together. The right hand pedal wouldn't go back on. Presumably the problem with it back in Alta meant the thread was messed up. With one pedal I hobbled to Kirkwall in the sunshine.</p>
				
				<p>I found the local bike shop; Cycle Orkney. There, Eric sorted my gears and I got new brake pads as Norway had worn through three sets. Unfortunately he didn't have a front wheel of the right size (I've has a crack in it for a long time now) so suggested a bike shop in Caithness. It would do for now.</p>
				
				<p>My sister had booked me a hotel for two nights so, with a serviced bike, I had the luxury of a bed and shower. Having craved affordable fish and chips for the past thousand kilometres, I went to the local fish and chip shop. I also visited the Coop where I had to be careful not to buy everything.</p>
				
				<p>The weather forecast for tomorrow was OK but getting worse on Monday. I should probably make the most of it.</p>

				<p>Well, that's it for my trip in Norway. I now cross the top of the North Sea to Orkney and pick up the Atlantic again from there.</p>
				
				<p>Last night at the Youth Hostel I met Luke. He had cycled from the UK taking a ferry from Hull to Rotterdam then up through Denmark and Sweden into Norway. He tells me his brother is currently cycling around the west of Scotland so I may bump into him.</p>

				<p>Getting to Bergen airport turned out to be really easy. About 12 km from it I picked up the 50 bike route that showed signs for the airport. So I ignored Google maps and followed the signs. South Bergen seems to have a great network of segregated bike lanes. It was really pleasant and, for Norway, incredibly flat. The signs gave regular updates on how far to go. They took me more or less to the terminal door. This was perhaps my favourite experience at an airport by bike.</p>

				<p>There are things I won't miss about Norway:</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>The steep hills</li>
				<li>The cost of food (&pound;4 for a green pepper)</li>
				<li>The cold rain</li>
				<li>The bad curbs from road to cycle/foot path</li>
				<li>The difficulty of knowing the cost of the ferries in advance</li>
				<li>The cold rain (there was a lot of it so it gets another mention)</li>
				<li>Norwegians saying "it won't be expensive" then the thing turning out to be expensive by non-Norwegian standards</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>But there are things I will miss about Norway:</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>The mountains</li>
				<li>The scenery</li>
				<li>The waving flags outside the Rema1000, Kiwi Pris, Bunnpris, X Extra, and range of Coop supermarkets showing where they are from down the road</li>
				<li>The Coop Xtra fiskekakke (fishcakes) which were 960g for 27 krones (perhaps the best value per calorie) </li>
				<li>The cyclists who had cycled from all over Europe to get to the Norwegian coastline and who shared advice and stories</li>
				<li>The friendly tourists in camper vans who helped the occasional long-distance cyclist </li>
				<li>The wild camping (despite the midges as I got further south)</li>
				<li>The polite drivers who left plenty of room when overtaking (they got slowly worse as I got further south)</li>
				<li>The letters &oslash;, &aring;, and &aelig;.</li>
				<li>The midnight sun</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Normally I don't have a clear favourite part of something but this time I do. For me, it was Senja. It was so dramatic with the mountains rising steeply out of the fjords and the colour of the water. Wild camping at the sandy beach at Ersfjord was just perfect.</p>
