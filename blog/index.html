				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-12T21:04+0100 " datetime="2017-07-12T21:04+0100 ">Wednesday 12th Jul 2017 (20:04 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>The rain had stopped by 8.30 or so. I packed everything up then had breakfast just in case it decided to start again. I had a nice short ride of a few kilometres to the ferry through the flat farmland. I turned up just as the ferry was unloading again. This one over to Valset was 38 krones. </p>
				
				<p>Valset was really just the ferry terminal with nothing else. I then had a surprise hill to climb before heading down to fjord-level to Lensvik. I stopped there to make lunch between light showers. Then 49 kilometres along (with a hill in the middle) to Orkanger at the fjord end. Just before Orkanger, my road was signed right but I went there extra couple of kilometres to the town to see the tourist info people. They turned out to be a hotel reception but they did let me use the WiFi and told me about the next hill on the E39. I then sat in a shopping centre having a 20 krones (bargain!) hot chocolate waiting out the rain before tackling the hill.</p>
				
				<p>The rain had stopped. I rode on. The hill started. My old, familiar friend, the 8% gradient sign, came into view. 1.6 kilometres of up. The rain was back too. The climb took me up to a big lake at around 180m altitude. I knew that the summit was at 380m but then I saw a sign for camping. After lots of long days, I decided this was it for today. I pitched my tent in a gap in the rain. The camping fee was a remarkable 50 krones meaning I had only overspent by 10 krones today.</p>
				
				<p>As i was ready to call it a night a Belgian cyclist named Ugo arrived. He also had a Garmin eTrex 20 so checked my memory card for me. It couldn't see the Norway map either. We swapped stories. He warned me that Kristiansund cost 85 krones to leave through the tunnel.</p>
				
				<p>Will the rain stop for a whole 24 hours? Will I get flooded in the night? What are the signs of trenchfoot?</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-11T22:40+0100 " datetime="2017-07-11T22:40+0100 ">Tuesday 11th Jul 2017 (21:40 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Standard start to the morning. The rain stopped and I packed. I had my now standard porridge with banana and Nutella (substitute, because it is a third of the price). I paid for my camping and the guy at the reception gave me advice on how many big hills to expect, and where to expect them, between Osen and Brekstad. As I was about to go, he rushed back inside his reception hut and produced a sticker for my bike! With it stuck on next to the Nordkapp one, I was off.</p>
				
				<p>Around the northern side of the fjord and over the bridge back to the south. Around the coast a bit more and then the first uphill started right where the campsite man had warned. Eventually I got to around 250m to a small wind farm he'd mentioned. The weather was overcast and threatening rain but yet to seriously deliver on that. I had the final big uphill for a while, taking me up to 360m or so. Then it was sort-of down to &Aring;fjord. That is, it was down on average.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped to have lunch at a sheltered picnic table outside a Coop. My luxury item today was a bag of own-brand, "xtra" value, tortilla chips. They were the cheapest crisps at 25 krones (&pound;2.50). A tube of Pringles will set you back between &pound;3 and &pound;4.50 depending on the shop. Given my cash budget is down to 17 krones daily, for the rest of my time in Norway, I won't be wasting it on those. I have to somehow afford essential food, ferry fares, and occasional campsite fees.</p>
				
				<p>With the hardest hills out of the way, I set off again. I had one more a few kilometres down the road that took me up to a junction. I had a choice. I could now follow the Dutch couple's route or the advice of the man from the campsite. I went with his suggestion which kept me truer to the coast but missed Trondheim out. I had been hoping to find somewhere there to take my empty gas canisters but that was weighed against the prices for places to stay. The Youth Hostel was apparently 770 krones! I turned right. </p>
				
				<p>I had more hills to climb. Given that these were of the 150m variety, they probably don't count to Norwegians. After a spell of rain, things cheered up and I could remove my waterproofs. I reached the coast again at Botng&aring;rd and cycled up around some headland to a flat farmland which seemed very out of place after the last few weeks. The fields felt like parts of the English coast but the farm buildings and flatness reminded me of parts of the Great Plains in Nebraska and eastern Iowa. That is, if you ignored the mountains in the backdrop. </p>
				
				<p>The road dropped down to the water, past an old Norwegian manor, to a little harbour and a campsite that had been recommended to me by the man at Osen. It was just after 7pm and I'd cycled 120 kilometres with 2.1 km of ascent (according to Google). I was tired. The man at the campsite reception was so surprised at how far I'd gone, and was going, that he decided he would let me stay for free. That was so kind of him. It also meant I stayed precisely on budget today. I was able to put my tent up in the evening sun so it dried out in time for the rain that started before I went to sleep.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-10T23:00+0100 " datetime="2017-07-10T23:00+0100 ">Monday 10th Jul 2017 (22:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It was raining. Yes, I know this is getting repetitive. I bundled things up and headed out into the midge-filled wet. I got my bike down from the rocky outcrop and cycled in the rain for a few kilometres before I found a picnic spot with a covered picnic bench. What a fantastic innovation! I had breakfast. I was running short of water though. </p>
				
				<p>I plodded through the miles. Norway requires everywhere to take three times as long to get to as you wind around fjords. Namsos looked so close on the large scale map but took ages to get to. Just before getting to it I was diverted away from the tunnel to use a bike path. It deposited me on a residential street with no obvious sign to the Tourist information office. I wandered all around Namsos looking for it. Eventually I found it but it was closed. It turns out it is the only day it is closed. The reception staff in the neighbouring hotel filled in and helpfully printed out Google map directions for me taking the Dutch couple's route.</p>
				
				<p>After a visit to the Rema 1000, the Coop Xtra, an electrical store to get a new USB cable, and a stop to make fried eggs, I was off south on the good old 17. It was busier though.</p>
				
				<p>Having charge back on my internet-enabled phone meant I could see my rough route I'd planned beforehand. Oh no. It turns out I was to do an extra twiddly bit south of Namsos. So at &Aring;rg&aring;rd I turned right into the mountains. It was 43 kilometres to Osen on the coast. Up and up the road went. It climbed up over 200 metres then had a fairly gentle slope down towards Osen. The smaller bumps near the end were the most sapping.</p>
				
				<p>I arrived at Osen Fjordcamping just after 8pm. The reception was closed. I don't have a sim card that can make calls in Norway but I realised I could Skype. The man at the other end of the phone told me to just pitch my tent and pay in the morning. A Swedish couple enquired about my trip and I caused much amusement for a group of raucous Norwegian OAPs.</p>
				
				<p>After a wet morning and afternoon, the evening had become quite sunny. The campsite was also midge free. Bliss.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-09T23:00+0100" datetime="2017-07-09T23:00+0100">Sunday 09th Jul 2017 (22:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I awoke to rain. It had rained all through the night. I tried waiting for it to stop but who knew when that would be? I packed everything up inside as best as I could. Some water had got in via the old floor of my tent. As I finally emerged into the light rain I was mobbed by the midges. The sooner I left here the better. A wet tent was packed up.</p>

				<p>I was now following the route of the Dutch couple so left the 17 and National Cycle Route 1 to take smaller roads to the ferry at Hofles. on the way I briefly chatted to a German man walking Norway. Traffic and rain meant I didn't want to hold him up. Further on I met Rudi and Ava from Switzerland cycling from Trondheim to Troms&oslash;.</p>

				<p>Once through Kolvereid the rain 
				stopped and it seemed quicker.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEYUFPkXUAAI0SP?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Kolvereid" /><figcaption>Kolvereid</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Somehow I ended up racing the ferry again and got to Hofles just before they had started loading. It cost 48 krones to travel south to L&uuml;nd. During the crossing the sun finally came out. I had feared I'd be stuck getting wetter and wetter for days. At L&uuml;nd, rather than cycle off, I took over a picnic bench to have a belated lunch and to finally dry the clothes I'd rinsed at the campsite two days ago. After a double fried egg sandwich, I treated myself to an ice-cream for 26 krones at the cafe as it was one of the few places to have been open today.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEYUU2rXgAEVMHE?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Ferry ride" /><figcaption>Ferry ride</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>The next ferry arrived and I waited for all the traffic to speed off before setting off myself. It was nice to be out of the rain but now I needed sun cream and had to take layers off due to the heat. The route headed up a 120 metre hill. Near the top I had a scramble up some rocks and got a glorious view in two directions. I hadn't gone as far as I'd planned but I resolved to camp here tonight. There was only the tricky matter of getting tent pegs in. Then my nemesis returned. No, not the rain, the midges! I retreated into my tent as the only midge-free place. I was denied the enjoyment of the view.</p>
