				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015007.html">Across the capital</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-08T23:00:00+0100" datetime="2015-05-08T23:00:00+0100">Friday 08th May 2015 (22:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Leaving the B&B I made my way out of Watford on rather scary dual carriageways filled with rush hour traffic. I escaped into a massive Tesco to get breakfast (the B&B was really just a B) and let the traffic die down a little. Then I accidentally got onto Edgware Road (Stevens' route) and had second breakfast. </p>
				
				<p>My route now deviated from Stevens' in order to visit his grave in East Finchley. I'd visited it last year before undertaking the US leg and now I was back to check in with him. Whilst at the grave I met Heather and Claudia who were teachers at a local school. They hadn't heard of Thomas Stevens and wished me well on my trip.</p>

				<p>I then headed for Spitalfields to visit my niece. London is slow going with all the traffic and traffic lights. You have to keep your wits about you to cycle in the capital. On reflection it is probably no worse than Boston had been and, in the congestion charge zone, it is possibly a little better. The best I could manage was an average of 6mph.</p>

				<p>I stayed at my niece's flat and had an attempt at an ice bath to try to help my knee.</p>
				
				<p>It was the night of the General Election. I'd voted by post before setting off but there was still the geeky excitement of the results coming in. I sat in bed watching coverage and Twitter until the early hours.</p>
				
				<p>The next morning I had a bit of a late start as I was only going as far as Surbiton. That would leave me without having to deal with too many slow London roads on the ride to Brighton.</p>
				
				<p>My route took me via the UK HQ of <a href="http://www.msf.org.uk">MSF</a> where I met some of their digital team - Ben and Nick. After that I visited Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace before a very busy dual carriageway to Hammersmith. Over the Hammersmith bridge I reached Barnes Common 130 years too late for a <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/000134.shtml#blog">tricycle rally</a>. I headed south through the glorious Richmond Park which is a green oasis in the urban sprawl. There was a herd of deer. Arriving into Kingston I rode for a short distance with a guy called Andy. In Surbiton I had a great welcome from my friend Tracey and her parents.</p>
				
				<p>I'd not covered big distances in the last two days but I'd more or less crossed the capital.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015006.html">Through the Chilterns to Watford</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-06T19:00:00+0100" datetime="2015-05-06T19:00:00+0100">Wednesday 06th May 2015 (18:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I alternated between main road and canal towpath this morning. On the main road I had large, high-sided trucks overtaking at 60 mph leaving minimal space. They blocked the wind sucking me towards them. After they passed I got buffeted by the wind again after. The towpath was slower but far safer and prettier. It also meant I could admire the wildlife.</p>

				<p>As the route swung around to the south, the side wind of the past couple of days turned into a bit of a head wind. I paused in Berkhampstead for pie and mash (not just any pie and mash - M&S pie and mash). There was a Penny Farthing hotel but it was over £115 a night! It seemed all the local accommodation was over £100 or fully booked. Onwards. I crossed the M25 - London's orbital motorway - and headed south to Watford.</p>

				<p>Over the phone I negotiated a £30 room in a B&B. In trying to find it, a big, blue, nox caught my attention. There was a TARDIS in someone's front garden. Next to it was a velociraptor and a robot dog! </p>

				<p>As I stopped to take a picture the owner jumped out and said he'd move his car for me. His name was "Ska-V-Goldsmith" (or Nigel) and he seemed to be a modern day polymath with claims of a background in nuclear fission, rocket science and art. Nigel was certainly a very interesting person.</p>
				
				<p>At the B&B I was greeted by Julien who was originally from the Congo and was a fan of <a href="http://justgiving.com/rtwbike">MSF</a>. He helped me get my bike into the back yard.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-05T219:00:00+0100" datetime="2015-05-05T219:00:00+0100">Thursday 14th May 2015 (02:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>In Allesley I stopped at The Village Barbers to get a trim. Actually I got a number 1 as then I don't have to worry about washing my hair for a while. Thanks to Max (?) and Stacey for the haircut and good wishes.</p>
				
				<p>It was a short ride into Coventry and I found the Starley Memorial. I stopped to recreate <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11189636485/">the illustration in Thomas Stevens' book</a>. In using the self-timer my camera blew over in the wind and I had to dive to the concrete to save it. I then co-opted local man Paul to take the picture for me. He recommended the Coventry Transport Museum so that is where I went next.</p>

				<p>The museum was being refurbished but was really good and had free entry. They started with the history of the Penny Farthing and progressed through the motor industry to the ThrustSSC.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/17171339007"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8723/17171339007_8389a1c133.jpg" alt="photo" title="Penny Farthings" /></a><figcaption>Penny Farthings</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>Even a quick look around the museum meant I left Coventry after midday. Last night I'd tried having a cold shower for 15 minutes on my knees. That was as close as I could get to an ice bath. It had seemed to have helped as it wasn't as sore as yesterday.</p>
				
				<p>I had some lovely views of Northamptonshire and reached Weedon Barracks by 15:45. The Barracks are no longer military so I couldn't get a pint of stout with an officer like Thomas Stevens did. Instead I briefly chatted to the security guard who let me take a picture.</p>

				<p>On the outskirts of Milton Keynes I paid a visit to the Cycle King bike shop to get spare break pads as mine are wearing down. I had a bit of a chat with the guys in the shop then pressed on around Milton Keynes. It didn't exist in Stevens' day so I was going to Fenny Stratford. Handily, Milton Keynes has a great network of cycle lanes so I was able to keep off road for quite a stretch.</p>
				
				<p>About 17:30 I arrived at Fenny Stratford which seemed to be a retail park. I gorged on high calory pizza and pasties at Greggs and purchased a bright pink 5100 mAh battery pack whilst searching for toilets. I needed somewhere cheap to stay and I found a campsite a few miles further on by the canal.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-04T20:00:00+0100" datetime="2015-05-04T20:00:00+0100">Monday 04th May 2015 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>After an attempted ride on Gordon's tricycle, in which I couldn't steer and headed for a ditch, I set off south to Stafford. South some more took me under the M6 and on the hunt for a toilet. This is surprisingly difficult on a Bank Holiday Monday as nowhere is open. After asking lots of clueless locals, I eventually found one in Bloxwich where I also stopped for a late lunch. Getting into big cities is slow going so I was glad to find a canal trail that took me to the site of the old tricycle works which long ago closed down. I stopped briefly for a picture at the fantastic library building.</p>

				<p>My right knee had started hurting yesterday and it was making it difficult to get up the little steep bridges on the towpath.</p>
				
				<p>Out of Birmingham I was on main road which wasn't to bad. Over the border into Warwickshire the roads became more rural and I stopped at Allesley, on the outskirts of Coventry, for the night</p>
