				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-14T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-10-14T23:59+0200">Saturday 14th Oct 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>My alarm went off an hour late because I still hadn't updated my phone.</p>

				<p>I arrived at Matalasca&ntilde;as in good time. Google maps and various blogs had told me I now needed to head almost to Seville to cross the river before heading back to the coast. So I rode 15km inland to El Rocio. At the Tourist Information Office, a ranger named Sonja told me I could shorten my trip by going back to the coast and going 32 km along the beach. I was dubious. My bike doesn't get along with sand. Would I sink? Sonja said she did it years ago on a racing bike with panniers. She said you had to do it after high tide on the wet sand. We checked the tide times. High tide was 11:50am. The timing seemed perfect. It did mean going 15 km back the way I'd just been and another 15 km back if it looked no good. But, it would shave off perhaps 100 km from the inland detour. I decided to risk it. It might get me to Cadiz today.</p>

				<p>I rode back to Matalasa&ntilde;as and got to the beach. The first 10 km proved to be tough going. I largely had to walk my bike as my wheels kept sinking. After that it became easier. Either because the beach was better or the tide was out more or both.</p>

				<p>I now found myself at the end of the beach. I waved the ferry but it may be unloading. Thankfully some fishermen on ebikes arrived. A few minutes later the ferry set off from Sanl&uacute;car de Barrameda.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017123.html">Back to Spain</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-13T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-10-13T23:59+0200">Friday 13th Oct 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>David and I were off by 9.15am. We kept a fast pace up for the next couple of hours before stopping to buy (and eat) some jicy oranges from a roadside stand. Then we rode to the border and caught the ferry over the river. I think David was happy to be back in Spain after 12 days. He had cycled 1142 km and the entire coast of Portugal.</p>

				<p>The ferry was reasonable &euro;3.50 (they charge for bicycles) and we saw big jellyfish in the river as we crossed.</p>

				<p>Back on Spanish soil we headed on. We were immediately faced with a 20% gradient hill which was tough after a few days of gentle roads. We raced on to Lepe where David was meeting a friend who had driven down to give him a lift home. They were going to have a couple of days break first. We shared beers at a bar in the centre and then said our farewells. It has been really nice to share the last day or so with David. I think he is planning a much longer trip in the future. Perhaps we'll meet again on the road some day.</p>

				<p>I lost an hour crossing the border. I prefer to think of it as giving back the hour I was given when entering Portugal. I updated one of my phones but forgot the other.</p>
				
				<p>I was now riding on alone. At the next town I visited a Carrefour and then sat eating food for an hour. Eventually I realised my phone I'd been checking for the time was an hour out and I really needed to move on. Back into the fierce heat I cycled after applying more suncream.</p>

				<p>I reached the campsite in Mazag&oacute;n just before sunset as has become the norm in the last week. It was &euro;7 and was really popular. The first spot I tried to pitch my tent was awful. Just under a surface of loose sand was concrete. Tent pegs don't work in those conditions.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017122.html">Meeting David</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-12T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-10-12T23:59+0200">Thursday 12th Oct 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Whilst sitting in the youth hostel reception I was told off by a Dutchman who was sharing my dormitory for not having said much to him. He generalised to me not being interactive. Who cares that I'd had a couple of conversations, in French, with the French people in the dormitory? Who cares that I have had conversations with almost everyone I've met for the past 115 days? Who cares that I may just want a chance to rest after 11300 km of cycling? Not actively having a conversation with him meant I am some kind of recluse.</p>
				
				<p>I set off late because of expecting a shorter ride as I was going to stay with a friend of a friend before Faro. But I hadn't heard back from them in a few days so I suspected they might be busy with other stuff and I'd be imposing.</p>

				<p>Not long after setting off I met another cyclist going the same way as me; we both got a bit lost in the one way system in Odi&aacute;xere. His name was David and he was from Barcelona. He had been cycling EuroVelo 1 along the coast of Portugal. We rode together on the understanding that we could go our separate ways if we felt like it. We went to a Lidl to get food and, comically, bought almost the same things. We sat outside on the ground eating and talking. It is funny how much you find in common with people doing big bike trips. So we rode on together. David passed his 1000 km milestone.</p>

				<p>A combination of not hearing back, worrying about how far I still had to cycle before my flight, and good company meant I took a decision. I decided to ride onwards with my new friend. We covered a good distance considering the late start. We passed beyond Faro. So, hopefully, I should get beyond Huelva tomorrow. That should keep me ahead of my rough schedule based on not having a proper route.</p>
				
				<p>Tonight David and I visited a supermarket and bought lots of food and some beers. Then headed to a campsite (&euro;4.20).</p>

				<p>We gorged on pasta, bread, fruit, chocolate salami, and biscuits. We chatted into the night about bike trips, life, running, people and lots more.</p>
				
				<p>It feels so comfortable talking to other people who've ridden by themselves. It was similar with Siri in Scotland and Sander in Norway. There is so much common experience but, also, I think having chosen to ride a long way alone means you share some similar outlooks. A huge part of these bike trips are the people you meet along the way. There is so much warmth, friendship, generosity, and shared humanity. (From all the people you meet, not just those on bikes)</p>

				<p>David had a good phrase today: on a bike trip you see the in-between.</p>

				<p>I was riding along quite happily when my GPS launched itself out of its holder and into the thorny undergrowth by the side of the road. Five minutes were lost locating it and then trying to fish it out with minimal blood loss from the thorny scratches. A few minutes later a big dog came bounding towards me from a shack. I slowed and got off my bike. That stopped its advance. The owners seemed to be shouting something at me from within the shack. My guess is that it was the classic "it won't hurt you". I never believe that. I cleared the area on foot then sped off.</p>

				<p>I reached Lagos (not the one in Africa) a whole hour before sunset. Such luxury! It was just as well as I got the last bed in the youth hostel. I am sharing my dormitory with a Dutchman and a French couple. My high school French has been in more use than I'd expected outside of France.</p>
				
				<p>For once I went and ate out; I found a little chicken shop. I then wandered the evening streets of Lagos like a regular tourist. It was funny to hear British accents.</p>
