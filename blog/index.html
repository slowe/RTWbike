				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-12T18:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-12T18:00:00+0200">Friday 12th Jun 2015 (16:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>At breakfast I chatted with Michael. He seemed to have been inspired by my trip, and his experience since Munich, and was itching to cycle on to Athens rather than stop in Belgrade. The only thing stopping him was the holiday with his girlfriend. I gave him my number in case he had any trouble as I'd be a day behind him. I'd been having trouble with Google Maps as it wouldn't let me save maps for offline in Hungary onwards. Michael told me he was using <a href="http://www.oruxmaps.com/index_en.html">Oruxmaps</a> and had been able to download country portions of <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> for it. This sounded great and I used the WiFi to get maps for Croatia and Serbia.</p>

				<p>I arrived at the Tourist Information Office just after 11 am having misjudged how many traffic lights there were between the hotel and it. I was met by Mrs Vesna Latinovic - a reporter from the local newspaper. The paper is a direct descendant of <em>Der Drau</em> whose assistant editor had met Thomas Stevens so this was very pleasing for everyone. After the interview and having my photo taken by the official photographer, Mislav took me for a "cyclist beer" in the main square. It actually turned out to be a shandy and was very nice. Mislav had been reading up on Stevens and had been excited to discover that after his bike ride around the world he went looking for the famous explorer Stanley in Africa. It turns out Mislav is related to the most trusted assistant of Stanley. What a coincidence! As we were sat talking about Croatia and Osijek, Mrs Latinovic came back. She had aquired some stickers for me! I immediately put one on my bike.</p>

				<p>In the afternoon I saw a penny farthing in the main square outside a bike shop. Unfortunately it was broken so I couldn't have a ride on it.</p>

				<p>Later I visited the site of <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/000174.shtml">the yew-shrub maze that Stevens had been to</a>. Mislav told me that unfortunately it no longer existed but was located where the football stadium now is. </p>

				<p>I headed back around to admire the fortifications of the old town before crossing the Drava river to spend some time at the "Copacabana". I followed the lead of the locals and had a swim in the Drava. Afterwards I found a restaurant on a boat and had the "perkelt" - a local dish that Mislav had recommended to me.</p>

				<p>Altogether I have had a fantastic time in Osijek and I won't forget the lovely people I've met.</p>

				<p>I crossed the river on the relatively busy 7.45 ferry to Dunaszekcs&#337;. It seemed to be the last one until 1 pm. Dunaszekcs&#337; was a hive of activity around the local shops and post office. Out of the village I headed on the south/western side of the Danube. This was the hillier bank with the other side having been a flood plain.</p>

				<p>At Mov&aacute;cs I enjoyed an ice cream and then bumped into lots of older British people here on a Saga cruise holiday. I chatted to a few and had one lady shout "Yorkshire Post" at me as I cycled out of town (I assume the Grand Depart Yorkshire top must have looked like the Yorkshire Post masthead to her).</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19427343316"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/505/19427343316_f3f6680b81_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Mov&aacute;s" /></a><figcaption>Mov&aacute;s</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I followed the EV6 to the border where I met my first passport control since Dieppe. The border guards were as serious and officious as they are almost everywhere but only looked at my passport for a few seconds before waving me through. K&ouml;sz&ouml;n&ouml;m Hungary. I was now in Croatia. The road signs were now yellow. </p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/18830952284"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/477/18830952284_b9688013f1_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Croatia" /></a><figcaption>Croatia</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Unfortunately I had to leave the EV6 on a road route to go to Branjin Vrh which I still can't pronounce. After a rather busy road I headed to "the Duke's vineyard" - Kne&#382;evi Vinogradi - and then south along the EV6 on-road route to Osijek.</p>

				<p>I rode over the bridge, through the old town, heading for the centre. I was earlier than normal and wanted to find the Tourist Information Office to ask about campsites. At the main square I saw the cathedral and then the familiar "i". Inside I said hello and the lady at the desk told me there was no camping but there was a hostel. Then she said I'd be better in a different place that was about the same price but I wouldn't have to take my bike upstairs (that didn't turn out to be correct). She rang ahead and booked me in. I then started telling her about the reason for my trip and that Thomas Stevens had been here for two days because it had rained. This caught the attention of her colleague, Mislav, who asked if he could photograph me for their Facebook group. We chatted some more and they insisted that I should come back to them tomorrow if I had any questions. With that friendly encounter I headed off to the room.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19265893900"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/280/19265893900_69e10c70ac_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Osijek Tourist Information Office" /></a><figcaption>Osijek Tourist Information Office</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At the hotel I was met by another friendly lady who didn't have many words of English but she'd already been briefed by phone so that helped. She registered me in a huge book that looked as though it may have been the register since Stevens' day.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19265919680"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/556/19265919680_1350e3bc3c_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Checking in" /></a><figcaption>Checking in</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>The room was on the top floor and was sweltering. I had a shower to cool down then went to ask about WiFi. On the way back to the room I saw a guy with a bike. He was Michael and had cycled from Munich throught he Alps. He knew about me already! Not because I was famous but because he'd also been to the Tourist Information Office. They had been surprised to get a second cyclist and sent him in my direction. After he had a shower we wanderd to the main square where we had the local Osijeko beer that Mislav had recommended to me. We exchanged stories about our trips. He turned out to be a PhD physicist so we also talked about the difficulties of PhD/postdoc life. Michael was heading on to Belgrade on a limited timescale as he was going to have a holiday with his girlfriend. We arranged to meet for breakfast.</p>

				<p>Back at the hotel the lady in charge was very excited about something. She took me to her desk and showed me a message from Mislav. She rang him back for me on her mobile. Apparently the local newspaper wanted to interview me. Mislav wanted to know if I could go back to them tomorrow. I said yes.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015037.html">Everything is awesome</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-10T20:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-10T20:00:00+0200">Wednesday 10th Jun 2015 (18:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>In the morning I took full use of the buffet breakfast and then got my things loaded on my bike for the 10 am check out. As I set off I realised the rear brakes were rubbing against the wheel. This must have been why I was so exhausted yesterday afternoon; I'd been struggling against far more friction than normal. Unloading my bike I discovered that I'd broken a spoke on the rear wheel and the wheel was not running true. I couldn't deal with another day of effort like yesterday so I switched out the new brakes for my old, worn-down ones so that the wheel could run freely. </p>
				
				<p>I needed to find a bike shop and thankfully there was one - Kelly's Bikes. In I went and, pointing to my bike, I was able to indicate that I needed my spoke fixing. I said I'd cycled from Liverpool and was going to Istanbul. Thankfully "Liverpool" and "Istanbul" are recognisable words. &Ouml;rs, the bike shop mechanic said "one hour" so I left my bike and my bags with him and his twin brother Kende. I was leaving my only means of transport and my belongings with people I'd never met before but a long distance cyclist learns to give their trust to local bike shops.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19457559881"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/535/19457559881_e9b447d53a_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="&Ouml;rs and Kende" /></a><figcaption>&Ouml;rs and Kende</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Whilst I was waiting I sat in the town square where they had free wifi. A girl came up to me and said "can you give me a number between 1 and 21". I thought I'd misheard her at first because it is a weird question. I hadn't misheard her. That was her question. I still don't know why.</p>
				
				<p>Back at Kelly's Bikes, &Ouml;rs and Kende had not only fixed my spoke but had put new brakes on for me. Amazingly they wouldn't charge me because I was on such a big ride. As thanks, I decided to purchase some cycling gloves from them as my hands had been getting a little tingly anyway and I'd left my last pair of gloves at home. I can't begin to say thank you enough for the amazing generosity of people I've met since San Francisco.</p>
				
				<p>It was already afternoon when I rolled out of Szeksz&aacute;rd (singing "Every<strike>thing</strike>one is awesome" to myself) and I'd decided I was heading back across the Danube to the EV6 rather than struggle with the no-bike signs of highway 6. The route east was long and straight and I wasn't entirely sure if it would get me to the M9 bridge over the Danube but it did via a local forest park and some farm tracks.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19265761038"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/547/19265761038_bac795ed71_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Natural bike parking" /></a><figcaption>Natural bike parking</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>It was great to be back on the EV6 even if occasional cars drove down it (ignoring the "no car" signs). As I reached Baja I found a huge Tesco where my hunter-gatherer mode kicked in and I stocked up on high-calorie food as I didn't know what to expect in Croatia. Every little helps.</p>

				<p>At Dunaflava I had missed the day's last ferry to Dunaszekcs&#337; where Stevens had stayed at Igali's house. Dunaszekcs&#337; would have to wait until tomorrow morning. I saw a "rooms for cyclists" sign in English which was promising. It turned out to be a nice guest house for cyclists on the EV6. I had a shower and then enjoyed "grapefruit beer" and a homemade lemonade courtesy of Susan and William whose house it was. They showed me their impressive vegetable garden and I sampled their cherry, apple, & apricot p&aacute;linka.</p>

				<p>After the hard slog and exhaustion of yesterday, today has been lovely.</p>

				<p>I needed new brake pads and Patrik told me about a bike shop in Duna&uacute;jv&aacute;ros but it didn't open until about 10 am. I passed some time in the local McD making use of their wifi to download offline language packs for Croatia, Bulgaria and Turkey for Google Translate.</p>
				
				<p>I arrived at the bike shop which was already busy and obtained new brake pads that were definitely fancier than the normal cheapo pads I buy. Outside the shop I installed them and the bike shop were kind enough to let me wash my hands and use their stand pump to get my tyres back up to pressure.</p>
				
				<p>Leaving Duna&uacute;jv&aacute;ros I had to, once again, go through sections where bicycles weren't allowed but no alternative was given (or it was closed due to being dug up). Patrick had shown me a route using Street View last night and I recognised enough of the local factories and roads to find my way to the M8 motorway bridge that has bike lane on the side of it.</p>

				<p>Back across the Danube I had some nice riding on the EV6 through small villages and sections that were separate from the traffic. At Harta the EV6 does an entirely needless detour that seems to have no real purpose or give any better views. At Dunapataj I had to head back to the Danube to find a ferry to cross to Paks. </p>
				
				<p>At the ferry I could see big dark clouds building to the west. I hadn't had any real rain since Munich and the relentless heat had been getting to me so I was looking forward to it. I put on my waterproof jacket which raised a smile from a guy on a motorbike who had just driven from Spain. On disembarking the ferry I met my first stumbling block which was highway 6. It had a "no bikes" sign. There was no other road. Yesterday afternoon Patrik told me that, in general, the "no bikes" rule applied to highways with numbers under 10. As I couldn't fly, I ignored the sign in order to get to the next minor road. I wasn't at all happy breaking the rules but Hungary seemed to make it needlessly difficult at times.</p>
				
				<p>In Paks I found a huge Tesco where I was able to use the facilities, buy food, and buy another USB battery pack to go with the one I got in Fenny Stratford. Leaving Paks, with the rain still not quite happening, I found <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/608335947684577281">a really good bike lane</a> that was separate to the road. To the west, lightning was striking the ground but still no rain. A little after 1 pm the bike lane emerged from some woods and I found myself passing under electricity pylons of many different styles. Probably not the best place to be during a lightning storm. </p>

				<p>At the little settlement of Cs&aacute;mpa all bike paths stopped and I was once again presented with a "no bikes" sign on highway 6. Not being able to fly the next few miles and no footpath available, I had to find another way. I back-tracked to the only alternative - a set of forest and farm tracks. These were awful. The first section was mostly soft sand which I've found is almost impossible to steer on with a heavy, loaded, bike.</p>

				<p>The going was tough. To make matters worse I found myself with explosive liquid bowel movements and had to make use of leaves to clean myself. Eventually the track got better and turned into a road but it still seemed really tiring. I arrived in Szeksz&aacute;rd having done 72 miles. </p>
				
				<p>A week or so before I'd arranged to stay with a cyclist in Szeksz&aacute;rd but he had contacted me to say he'd won a holiday so wouldn't be around. He told me there wasn't a campsite nearby. Online I found a place that described itself as a "hostel" but when I got there it seemed to be a kind of boarding school and they clearly didn't take guests. In the end, through exhaustion, I gave in an forked out for a hotel room. That used up an entire day's budget but at least I could get a shower and a good night's sleep. They also, slightly grudgingly, let me take my bike up to the room.</p>
