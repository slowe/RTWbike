				<h2 class="title"><a href="0018.html">The biggest little city in the world</a></h2>

				<p>Chris was going to show me the way to Reno that avoided the freeway but that meant we had to get an early start so at 7am we set off on a route which met up with old parts of Lincoln Highway. We crossed a few tressel railway bridges and the going was tough in the loose rock with my heavy back-end. At one point I fell over and later discovered I'd lost my rear light.</p>
				
				<p>This morning's route was probably the closest to Stevens' route I've been. There were even moments trundling along the timbers of the railroad track to cross the Truckee River.</p>

				<p>We hit the Pyramid-Tahoe trail and I had to get off and push my bike a few more times. As we crossed into Nevada we hit paved roads. A few miles later, at about 10.30am we stopped by the river in Reno at the Hub coffee shop. I was impressed by the iPad till that displayed a periodic table of drinks on it.</p>

				<p>Here I was in Reno. Casino city. The sum total of my knowledge of Reno came from the movie Sister Act. I couldn't see any nuns in helicopters though.</p>

				<p>Chris had put a plea out on Facebook last night asking if anyone would host me in Reno. The owner of the Reno Bike Project - Noah - had kindly offered. Chris left me at the bike shop where I bought a new light and some lubricant. Noah gave me directions to his house and we met there a little while later. I said I needed a camping stove (I couldn't really bring mine from the UK) so he sent me off in the direction of a REI. The shop had everything you could want for an outdoors trip. I ended up buying a sleeping bag liner (adds 3.6 degrees C for the cold desert nights), a rear-view mirror, some dehydrated camping food, suncream (SPF 50), a sun hat, spare breaks and granola bars. I spent far too much money.</p>
				
				<p>Once back at Noah's, despite the fact he'd had a 12 hour work day, he took me to a local pub to get food. He also told me about a website - warmshowers - that is specifically for long distance cyclists.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0017.html">Down to Truckee</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-04-28T20:00+PDT" datetime="2014-04-28T20:00+PDT">Monday 28th Apr 2014 (20:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>Over the pass and down across the famous bridge I sped. Losing so much altitude, so quickly, left me hoping my break pads would last. How Stevens did all this on a penny farthing amazes me more as the trip progresses. </p>

				<p>Along Donner Lake and into Truckee I had a hard time finding any cafes open. Eventually I spotted a classic American diner by the railroad so went in there for food and drink. I discovered that "baked beans" weren't the same as the Heinz ones we have back in the UK. I made use of the free wifi to Skype back home and checked in with someone who'd offered to host me. </p>
				
				<p>A couple of months before my trip I'd been planning a route through this part of the country and discovered a bike trail being planned. I'd emailed the lady in charge of that to ask for advice for avoiding the freeway and she put me in touch with a local, Chris. We'd exchanged emails and Chris had offered me a room for the night when I passed through.</p>
				
				<p>I left the diner and headed over to Chris's house. He welcomed me in, offered me a very welcome shower and then we went and got Mexican food. Back at his house we had ice-cream (bring on the calories), had a beer, watched a film, and chatted with his son who was doing a dissertation on Formula 1. Chris also has a penny farthing and he let me wheel it around his garage. Unfortunately I couldn't ride it as it was dark outside and he lived on a hill so that would have been unwise. Chris was a brilliant host.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0016.html">Donner Pass</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-04-28T15:10+PDT" datetime="2014-04-28T15:10+PDT">Monday 28th Apr 2014 (15:10 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>After peering into the old railroad tunnel that Thomas Stevens had walked through, I headed on towards the famous Donner Pass. As I neared it I dragged my bike off the road, up through the snow and onto some rocks to take in the view. And what a view it was!</p>

				<p>It was tremendous. I'd got here by my own effort. This was the longest and hardest bike trip I'd ever done and the cold, the tiredness, the fear, and the slog had all been worth it for this.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0015.html">To the top of the Sierra Nevadas</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-04-28T15:00+PDT" datetime="2014-04-28T15:00+PDT">Monday 28th Apr 2014 (15:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>In the morning I went downstairs at 7.30 am and Joanne had made a great breakfast spread of eggs, bacon, bagel and cream cheese, a selection of fruit pieces, orange juice, and coffee. This was perfect for someone who had been cycling uphill for the past week. I packed and was wished well for my journey. I promised to send a postcard once I'd finished.</p>
				
				<p>The day ahead was a big one. There was a 12 mile section of freeway and over 3000ft of ascent. I rode along to Baxter and joined the freeway. I was following instructions form the Old Highway 40 pamphlet Eric had given me back in Colfax. The freeway, being a motorway, was not somewhere I felt that comfortable being so I stayed well over to the right of the hard shoulder. Actually, it turned out to be much more pleasant than I expected. Most of the trucks even pulled out a lane even though there would have been plenty of space. So I generally had a huge, full-American-lane-sized hard shoulder and another lane of gap. What a difference to UK roads where you are lucky if you get a foot of clearance. </p>
				
				<p>About three cars beeped on this section of freeway. The beeps weren't agressive and I decided to take them as signs of encouragement on the constant uphill to over 5000ft. Then, behold! A stunning view out to the snow capped Sierra Nevadas. The long slog of a climb had been worth it. It was breath taking (and not just because of the effort). I couldn't stop to take a picture though as I was on a freeway.</p>
				
				<p>I had a brief stop in Nyack for a large 40oz soda and brief rests at every junction as I felt it safer to leave the freeway on the exit than possibly have a speeding car hit me as it took the exit not expecting a bicycle to be there.</p>
				
				<p>At Cisco Grove I finally left the freeway and stopped for a toilet break. Here I met a Brazilian man and we communicated via tiny amounts of English and surprising amounts of my broken Italian! He introduced me to his family and explained to them I was going to Boston. His dad was really interested in my Highway 40 guide and looked like he wanted one. I'd have given him mine but I was actually in need of it.</p>
				
				<p>Over the freeway I joined up with the old 40 and parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Highway">Lincoln Highway</a>. The road was the first trans-continental highway for cars and out in the west followed the railroad that had gone before it. Later, the interstate system came in following a very similar route. There were old tourist shops that had been abandoned since the I-80 cut through the area. The trees were thinning out with altitude so I was less worried abut cougars hiding in them. I did sing though for the bears and my own entertainment. I sang some <em>Ford Econoline</em>, <em>Climb Every Mountain</em> and a medly of mountain related bits of songs I could remember.</p>

				<p>In Big Bend I saw a really old section of Lincoln Highway as well as beautiful sections of stream. Still upwards went the road. I started counting off every 500ft of ascent and then every 100ft. Somewhere around 6500ft I was passed by a "Lowe's" van. Having become a little superspicious in the mountains I took this as a good omen.</p>

				<p>I reached the "Summit Hotel" but was disappointed to see that I wasn't at the top yet. Along at Soda Springs I saw a little museum so back tracked to have a look. Inside I met Norm Sayler who knew everything about Donner Summit. He showed me old photos of a 1903 bicycle trip over the summit by two unknown gentlemen. They had safety bikes by then so no penny farthings. Norm also gave me a free espresso possibly because he was so happy to actually have a visitor who was showing some interest. He had previously owned the summit ski resort and had, unknowningly at the time, let the inventor of the mountain bike use his ski lift to go up and down all day to test it.</p>

				<p>I left Norm's museum with the advice to look for a tunnel - Tunnel 6 - as I headed over the summit as Stevens probably went through it. He also told me to keep an eye out for ancient petroglyphs but I wasn't eagle eyed enough to spot them.</p>
