				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-05T219:00:00+0100" datetime="2015-05-05T219:00:00+0100">Thursday 14th May 2015 (02:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>In Allesley I stopped at The Village Barbers to get a trim. Actually I got a number 1 as then I don't have to worry about washing my hair for a while. Thanks to Max (?) and Stacey for the haircut and good wishes.</p>
				
				<p>It was a short ride into Coventry and I found the Starley Memorial. I stopped to recreate <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11189636485/">the illustration in Thomas Stevens' book</a>. In using the self-timer my camera blew over in the wind and I had to dive to the concrete to save it. I then co-opted local man Paul to take the picture for me. He recommended the Coventry Transport Museum so that is where I went next.</p>

				<p>The museum was being refurbished but was really good and had free entry. They started with the history of the Penny Farthing and progressed through the motor industry to the ThrustSSC.</p>

				<p>Even a quick look around the museum meant I left Coventry after midday. Last night I'd tried having a cold shower for 15 minutes on my knees. That was as close as I could get to an ice bath. It had seemed to have helped as it wasn't as sore as yesterday.</p>
				
				<p>I had some lovely views of Northamptonshire and reached Weedon Barracks by 15:45. The Barracks are no longer military so I couldn't get a pint of stout with an officer like Thomas Stevens did. Instead I briefly chatted to the security guard who let me take a picture.</p>

				<p>On the outskirts of Milton Keynes I paid a visit to the Cycle King bike shop to get spare break pads as mine are wearing down. I had a bit of a chat with the guys in the shop then pressed on around Milton Keynes. It didn't exist in Stevens' day so I was going to Fenny Stratford. Handily, Milton Keynes has a great network of cycle lanes so I was able to keep off road for quite a stretch.</p>
				
				<p>About 17:30 I arrived at Fenny Stratford which seemed to be a retail park. I gorged on high calory pizza and pasties at Greggs and purchased a bright pink 5100 mAh battery pack whilst searching for toilets. I needed somewhere cheap to stay and I found a campsite a few miles further on by the canal.</p>

				<p>After an attempted ride on Gordon's tricycle, in which I couldn't steer and headed for a ditch, I set off south to Stafford. South some more took me under the M6 and on the hunt for a toilet. This is surprisingly difficult on a Bank Holiday Monday as nowhere is open. After asking lots of clueless locals, I eventually found one in Bloxwich where I also stopped for a late lunch. Getting into big cities is slow going so I was glad to find a canal trail that took me to the site of the old tricycle works which long ago closed down. I stopped briefly for a picture at the fantastic library building.</p>

				<p>My right knee had started hurting yesterday and it was making it difficult to get up the little steep bridges on the towpath.</p>
				
				<p>Out of Birmingham I was on main road which wasn't to bad. Over the border into Warwickshire the roads became more rural and I stopped at Allesley, on the outskirts of Coventry, for the night</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-03T21:45:00+0100" datetime="2015-05-03T21:45:00+0100">Sunday 03rd May 2015 (20:45 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I left from central Warrington at about 9.20 am and made my way out onto the Knutsford Road (45 casualties said the red sign).I reached Knutsford by 10.30 and was met by my friend Peter who had arrived by car to visit the Knutsford Penny Farthing Museum.</p>
				
				<p>The museum was hidden away in a courtyard and was run by a man who had cycled from San Francisco to Boston on a penny farthing 20 years ago. Unfortunately, he wasn't in today but we got to see their collection and had a hearty breakfast.</p>

				<p>At Knutsford I said goodbye to Peter and continued on over Cheshire lanes to Jodrell Bank home of the mighty Lovell Telescope. I'd spent a few years working there so I was on lanes I knew. I stopped at the new Visitor Centre to see it and have a nice, relaxing, cup of tea. With it being a Sunday none of the people I knew were around and some had retired but I had a good chat with Jill and Soliyta. Over tea I also got talking to two cyclists -Chris and Owen - who were organising a charity ride from Edinburgh to London in July.</p>
				
				<p>Heading on from Jodrell, out beyond the Red Lion at Swettenham, I stopped for a chat with David who was cycling to Sandbach.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/17163330147"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8690/17163330147_e1e7e1680c.jpg" alt="photo" title="image" /></a></figure></p>
				
				<p>I pressed on beyond the area I knew to Congleton where I picked up the lovely Biddulph Valley Way cycle trail. It slowly ascended upwards along a wooded track but with occasional views of lambs lazing in the sunshine. The weather had been mixed this morning but had stayed dry this afternoon.</p>
				
				<p>Around Stoke-on-Trent I had some tricky points on National Cycle Network where the gates became impossible to get through with panniers and a very steep hill. In the middle of Stoke-on-Trent there was some confusing routing but I managed to hit the canal trail along to Stone where I was staying with the wonderful Taylors. Gordon had ridden across America, bits of Canada, and lots of Europe so was a wealth of stories and information. They were excellent hosts and made a great fish pie for dinner.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015002.html">Leaving of Liverpool</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-02T19:20:00+0100" datetime="2015-05-02T19:20:00+0100">Saturday 02nd May 2015 (18:20 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I started out from New Brighton where I dipped my wheel in the sea and my dad waved me off. Along the front in the rain I found the famous Ferry Across the Mersey. Whilst waiting I talked to some lightweight tourers who told me that my bike was too heavy. I said I should be fine having done this before.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry turned out to be a 40 minute cruise up and down the Mersey so I arrived at All Saints church at Edge Hill 20 minutes late. Awaiting me was my friend Peter who was going to accompany me out to Warrington much as the Anfield Bicycle Club had with Thomas Stevens 130 years ago.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/17344758726"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7732/17344758726_f8b9184f7b.jpg" alt="photo" title="At Edge Hill church" /></a><figcaption>At Edge Hill church</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Just like Stevens, we were heading along Edge Hill Road and the capricious British weather threw wind and rain at us. We manage to catch a section of National Cycle Network along and old train line which was much more pleasant than city roads. As we left Liverpool we  took in views both rural and industrial along the Wirral.</p>

				<p>With the light starting to fade we made it in to Warrington.</p>
