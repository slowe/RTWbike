				<p>I'd been writing blogvposts about the days after Paris on my 
				phone and had't got around to posting them. Unfortunately, 
				as you'll read next, my phone screen broke and now I can't 
				access them. Hopefully I can get them back once I return 
				home to the UK. For now, we'll have to skip on to Munich.</p>

				<p>It rained through the night so in the morning I did my best to dry my tent. Clotilde lent me their foot pump to get my tyres back to pressure. Once they were packed up they set off on their impressive tandem and trailer. I left a couple of minutes behind them. By 10.30 I was in Mantes-la-jolie and once again decided to over-rule my GPS and go the quieter roads. These proved hilly but pleasant and helped by the courteous drivers. In Maule I happened to glimpse Clotilde and Pierre in a bus shelter. I stopped and joined them for lunch. They had just boiled up some minestrone. It was so nice to meet them again. After lunch our paths really did diverge as I headed fort Saint Germain and they went more south.</p>

				<p>On the outskirts of Saint Germain I stopped at a shopping centre for free WiFi and to buy a plug adapter (needlessly it would turn out because I had my worldwide one with me and had forgotten about it). It was at this point that the long threatened rain finally came. Thankfully I was under shelter.</p>
				
				<p>After the deluge had abated I set off again through the charming Saint Germain end Laye. Over the river again I ignored my Gps's claim of 45 miles and went along a pleasant riverside bike path. It eventually turned into quiet, one-way Road. I was going the wrong way but the signs said "sauf velos" so I was OK. It explained why my GPS wasn't happy. Back over the bridge I was hoping to get into Paris before the rush hour. I may have been helped by a public holiday as it was fairly quiet and much easier riding than London.</p>
				
				<p>I reached Port Maillot and then another mile to the Arc de Triomphe for an obligatory photo opportunity. Here I got a crepe with Nutella for two-thirds the price of one on Brighton pier.</p>

				<p>Today was an early start as Pierre and Marie had to take the children to school. As I had to visit Thomas Stevens' locations I had to go back over the Seine to Elbeuf then I tried my best to stay on small, quiet, roads (all very well paved) where possible through Gaillon to Vernon. My knee seemed to be bearing up surprisingly well. Pierre and Marie's magic cream must have helped. </p>

				<p>At Vernon I decided to jump to the other side of the Seine where the map showed a cycle path even if my GPS really didn't want to route me that way. Ignoring its protestations the route was great.</p>

				<p>In trying to find accommodation for the night, Google Maps was only showing expensive options. The reason for this became obvious when I arrived in Giverny home of Claud Monet. It is now a tourist trap and half the voices in the little Street were American. With a small daily budget I limited myself to just visiting Money's house and garden rather than the Impressionist Museum too. The flower and water gardens were particularly fragrant and pretty.</p>
				
				<p>Leaving the flowers behind I headed for  a campsite Les Groux which had looked like being €20 online but the friendly lady at reception only charged me €10 as I was alone and without a car.</p>
				
				<p>After pitching my tent I met Leonard and Clotilde who were cycling on a tandem from Rouen to Versailles as a practice for cycling to the south of France later in the summer. They gave me more magic pomade for my knee and told me about their ride from Edinburgh to Brighton last year. It was great to talk to them and helped cheer me up some more. A large fraction of long distance cycling is the mental attitude and a combination of my knee pain and the worry over languages, money, and the difficulties ahead had been affecting me. Since New Haven I'd decided to limit my sights to Paris as I could get the train home from there if I felt terrible.</p>
