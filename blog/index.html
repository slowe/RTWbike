				<p>We all woke early. Not too early as sunrise is getting later. Breakfast was eaten. I had my usual porridge with banana and honey. We paid at the campsite office and were off in the cold, crisp, morning air. It was a glorious blue sky. I was frustrated that the forecast said it would change to rain in the afternoon.</p>

				<p>In Vannes we visited the tourist information office. I had been worried about the bridge at Saint-Nazaire. Some people on the Internet said it was highly dangerous and should be avoided. Others suggested it was no worse than British roads but probably not to do it in gusty winds. The lady at the tourist information office found there was a bus that would take bikes. That would be my fall back plan if I got to it and it looked too dicey.
				[B
				Outside the office, as I was saying 
				goodbye to my new cycling friends, a 
				big group of Yorkshire tourists 
				mobbed me. My new French friends 
				found it quite amusing. I was told I 
				should get my photo in the Yorkshire 
				Post.</p>

				<p>I said goodbye to everyone and left the pretty city of Vannes wondering how long the blue sky would last.</p>
				
				<p>Navigation is now via a combination of paper maps from tourist information offices, OpenStreetMap on my GPS (thanks Noel for sorting out the replacement!) and Google maps. I tried to follow the shape of the coast but was conscious that I should reach the big bridge before Friday evening rush hour which I presume the French have too. At Le Barrage I was about 10 minutes too late and the bridge was up. I had a half hour wait for the sailing boats to navigate the lock.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="portrait"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DJyKEJGXUAAdt0q?format=jpg" alt="portrait" title="Le Barrage" /><figcaption>Le Barrage</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>After Le Barrage the roads were flatter than I've been used to. Progress was good. The threatened rain was threatening but somehow I seemed to be gliding along between showers. My timing was clearly impeccable today.</p>
				
				<p>On the outskirts of Saint-Nazaire a road was closed. I was diverted several kilometres. Despite the delays I reached the bridge by 4.30. Phew. Hopefully before rush hour. The bridge was big. But I reminded myself of the tunnels and bridges in Norway. Plus the traffic was limited to 70 kmph and French drivers are more courteous than British ones. It was actually better than commuting in Leeds but with a slightly scary and exhilarating view of the whole area. By the top I was enjoying it. It was a fast but relatively gentle slope down to the other side. I'd survived. I imagine it would feel much worse with gusty winds. </p>

				<p>It was now 5pm. The Eurovelo 1 route had finally rejoined me on the coast after its inland jaunt from Roscoff. </p>
				
				<p>I rode on the EV1 for a bit then lost it before Pornic. I stocked up on food for tonight at an Intermarche. The threatening rain clouds had now gone and it was a lovely sunny evening. I would need to stop soon. I seemed to be in an area lacking campsites on Google maps; the next ones would only be reached by sunset. However, a campsite appeared in just the right place. The reception had closed but there just happened to be a man who knew the campsite owner waiting to drive in. He insisted I get in his van and he showed me where I could pitch and where the shower block was.</p>

				<p>I ate lots.</p>
				
				<p>At the back of my mind since Norway has been the idea that I might be able to wave at Mark Beaumont somewhere near Bordeaux as he gets near the end of his record breaking round the world ride. There are something like 380 km to go. He'll reach Bordeaux tomorrow or at some point on Sunday. I'm a day or two short, unfortunately.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-09-14T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-09-14T23:59+0200">Thursday 14th Sep 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>The sun was only just rising and I was ready to be off. But first I needed to sort out my bike. I gave it as much of a clean as I could with some baby wipes before changing the rear tyre for the one I bought in the rain last night. I then had to readjust the brakes. All in all this took more time than I realised and so it was a late start.</p>

				<p>The tourist information office wasn't a great help in providing route suggestions so I headed off on La Littoral around the harbour. On the outskirts of Concarneau I stopped at the supermarket and ate lots of calories. That delayed me further. </p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DJtZlT3W0AAAint?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Concarneau this morning" /><figcaption>Concarneau this morning</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>The coast is annoyingly lumpy here with no nice routes around the lumps. I don't like doing out and back routes unless there is a special reason. So I had to stay inland a bit following the general shape of the coast. At least the weather was an improvement on yesterday. I made good time to Lorient.</p>

				<p>As I was cycling by Lorient's station I spotted a place named Sykell. It turned out to be a community bike workshop like the Pedaller's Arms in Leeds. Martin, who ran things, gave me some orange juice and let me look at Google maps on the computer. I also discovered that the Warm Showers website does work; just not from any browser on my phone or via the app. If it had worked since Alta I might have had a less stressful time camping in the rain.</p>

				<p>There was also a 74 year old cyclist who kept giving me very detailed routing instructions in French. I think I got the main points. With an "au revoir" I was off on my way out of Lorient. Later than planned.</p>
				
				<p>I'd been told to turn right by a place that sold tyres (pnu) and there would be a bike shop too. There was. Outside of it were two people with full panniers. They were Manu and Fleur from Lyon (let me know if I misremembered your names). They were cycling around Brittany in practice for a future trip to cycle Europe, Africa, and the Americas. They suggested we could all cycle together for a while. I felt bad for throwing away the 74 year old's route so soon after he'd told me it but taking opportunities is part of this trip.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DJtapxxXcAA-m5S?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Fleur and Manu" /><figcaption>Fleur and Manu</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>As it turned out, Manu ended up on the 74 year old's route anyway. Great minds clearly think alike. It was nice to ride with people and Manu and Fleur were both about the same speed as me so we made good progress.</p>

				<p>At Saint Anne d'Aurey we bought supplies in a little shop. French supermarket aisles seem to have a war over putting the most vegetables in soup. There was "8 vegetable soup", "10 vegetable soup", "15 vegetable soup" etc. Where does it end?</p>
				
				<p>We continued on and stopped at a campsite in Bono. The reception had closed but we were told we could pay in the morning. We shared baguettes, melon, cheese, pate, many vegetable soup, and beer.</p>

				<p>It was a clear night. Despite my lack of glasses I was able to point out a few constellations and the Milky Way.</p>
				
				<p>No rain and new friends on the road. A great day.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017093.html">Hesitation, repetition, and deviation</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-09-13T21:52+0200" datetime="2017-09-13T21:52+0200">Wednesday 13th Sep 2017 (19:52 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I woke up to the familiar refrain of rain. I waited. It didn't let up. Eventually I gave in and took my tent down in the wet. I had a very late start.</p>
				
				<p>The first part of today was to cycle to Pont de T&eacute;r&eacute;new. My GPS claimed it was 77 km. It didn't look that far. My GPS wanted me to go back via Brest and a ferry. I pressed on ignoring it's advice. Eventually it sorted itself out and realised there was a much shorter route the way I was going. </p>
				
				<p>I reached the bridge then had a big hill to climb. I've been up bigger but this was big by Brittany standards.</p>

				<p>The rain didn't let up. The cycle route seemed to truncate this regional Park peninsula and that was fine by me. I was gradually getting totally wet. At Douarnenez I had a choice. I could cycle out to Plogoff and back or head south. I was cold and wet and might just reach the warmth and dry of a youth hostel if I chopped it off. I ate late lunch then decided I wanted to be dry.</p>
				
				<p>A couple of miles south my tyre went flat. Drat. It was the same reason as Monday. The side of my rear tyre was worn and it had punctured in the same place. I'd need a new tyre. I switched the inner tube and gingerly pressed on. After Pouldergat there was a sign saying a bridge was closed 2 km ahead. I was diverted. Eventually I rejoined the road at Landudec where I went in a big supermarket to use my phone in the dry. I quickly found an Intersport at Pont-l'Abb&eacute;. It was open until 7pm. I could make that. Could I also get to the Youth Hostel before the reception shut?</p>
				
				<p>I got to the Intersport just before 6pm. They didn't have a Schwalbe marathon plus so I had to make do. I bought it but I didn't change it. There wasn't time. I had 36 km to go in 1 hour 54 minutes. That meant a lot faster than I've done. Thankfully it was much less hilly and there were some good bike lanes. I kept estimating my time based on 15 kmph and revised it down as I went. I gradually pulled the minutes back from an ETA of 8:36pm. I reached the Youth Hostel at 7:52pm with 8 minutes to spare before the reception closed. It took a good 10 minutes for the man to complete all the paperwork. French accommodation seems to like paperwork. </p>
				
				<p>I had a shower and got dry. My wrinkly hands slowly returned to normal. I hung up my clothes with the hope that they would dry overnight.</p>
