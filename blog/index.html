				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017025.html">Beautiful day </a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-07T20:10+0100 " datetime="2017-07-07T20:10+0100 ">Friday 07th Jul 2017 (19:10 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I awoke to rain. I wasn't for stopping. I packed up as much as I could inside my tent to spend as little as I could outside. By the time I finished it had lessened but I was in cloud. Not to worry because I knew my route was about 16km down to the ferry at Nesna.</p>
				
				<p>The wet and hairpin bends of the past few days were wearing down my rear brakes. They'll need changing soon. But not now in the rain and cold. As I dropped west of the rainy mountain, the weather brightened. Via a food stop at the Coop (fishcakes!) I rolled into the ferry terminal to see Claudia already waiting. She'd camped where I'd seen her yesterday but she got an earlier start during a 15 minute gap in the rain. I made myself breakfast of fried egg sandwiches with ketchup, along with some hot chocolate. I had only just made the hot chocolate when the ferry arrived so casually walked my bike on-board holding it. As you do.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry ride to Levang was quite quick and the I rode with Claudia the 32 kilometres to Sandnessj&oslash;en. The weather was improving steadily and I got my solar panels out and strapped them over my Ikea bag. Despite a bit of traffic, it was enjoyable to be able to chat with someone.</p>
				
				<p>We crossed over the Helgelandbrau into Sandnessj&oslash;en. There we found the tourist information office both for information and the free WiFi. The office was part of a big, new, building that also housed a nice library, a cultural venue, and possibly a cafe. I didn't explore the cafe as I know I can't afford the prices in them. After posting photos I headed over to the Rema 1000 to get some food. Given the lack of supermarkets on the previous days, I bought more than I'd planned. So had Claudia. We ate some of it, sat in the sunshine, so that it would fit in our bags.</p>
				
				<p>We left along a smaller Road than the 17 but eventually had to climb a rather steep Road over a ridge. The view at the top was worth it though; we got to see the "seven sisters" which are a string of peaks in a row. The seventh, I assume, was the little bump on the end. A few kilometres further on I said goodbye to Claudia as she was camping here to walk the seven sisters tomorrow. I needed to get the ferry to Forvik today to keep on schedule for my flight. The next 24 kilometres were surprisingly flat compared to what I've experienced until now. With the sunshine and blue skies it was easy going. I was on time for the ferry again at Tj&oslash;travel and had a very pleasant hour-long ride to Forvik via the islands of Mindlandet and Tropical and a place on the mainland that was otherwise inaccessible.</p>
				
				<p>At Forvik I saw a sign for camping. After a little confusion over prices - I thought they wanted 100 krones for me to have a shower but it was just a deposit for the key to the shower - I pitched my tent. In the dry! Although my feet started the day wet, they were now dry too. What a beautiful day this had been.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017024.html">The biggest fjord yet </a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-06T21:10+0100 " datetime="2017-07-06T21:10+0100 ">Thursday 06th Jul 2017 (20:10 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I woke to the pitter patter of rain on my tent. Again. It eased a bit by about 8.30 so I put it away wet again but without me getting too wet. Except for my feet. Will they ever be allowed to be dry for a full day?</p>
				
				<p>It was a steep climb to start the day over to Tjong then around Tjongsfjorden and through the 3.2 km long Straumdaltunnelen which rose for 2 km before flattening off. As I sped down to Jektvika I was worried by a wave of vehicles. Had I missed the ferry? I needn't have worried. It turned out I'd timed it perfectly again. This ferry cost 66 krones as it was an hour long trip. However it was also special. It would take me over the Arctic Circle. The start of the ride was sunny but, as we approached the point in question, the rain set in as if to make a point that I may be leaving the Arctic but that didn't mean sunshine and clear skies. This is the Atlantic coast after all.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry deposited me at Killboghamn. Once again this turned out to consist of nothing but the ferry terminal. I asked a lady if there were any shops for food supplies. She said "one mile along on the right". It was a long one mile. It felt more like 10. This part of the coast seems more remote. Although there are frequent "villages" they are mostly just a few spread out houses. Gone are the frequent Coops I was used to up north. My phone is now on "Edge" which also suggests there aren't enough people to justify the expense of upgrading the network. That makes the Internet achingly slow.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped short of Stoke&aring;gen at a cafe and had a 45 krones coffee and cake. I then started around a huge fjord that just kept going. At least I was staying just ahead of the rain along the northern side. But I could see the southern side seemed to be in permanent rain. I imagine the mountains were the cause. That was to come. As I discovered, as well as rain, this southern side presented a big climb. Up and up it went. At 240m I saw a bicycle and stopped. It was Claudia from yesterday. She was huddled by her bike eating some food she'd cooked. She said the locals at the end of the fjord complained about the rain from the mountain.</p>
				
				<p>I carried on in the hope that crossing over the summit would take me out of the rain. The summit of the road was at 340 metres with an annoying drop of about 70 metres before a climb back to 320 metres. As I'd hoped, the rain lessened over the top. It was only about 15 km to Nesna for the next ferry but I'd done enough so stopped at 285 metres in a picnic spot with a WC and a stunning view out to the Atlantic.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017023.html">In time for the ferry</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-05T21:00+0100 " datetime="2017-07-05T21:00+0100 ">Wednesday 05th Jul 2017 (20:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Another day putting away a wet tent. I put it inside a plastic bag to stop it making my sleeping bag and liner wet during the day in my pannier. Having camped at altitude (relative) I had a downhill section to start the day. The rain was cold. My feet were wet from putting on my shoes. It feels as though my feet have barely been dry since I started. I wonder if I'm getting trenchfoot. </p>
				
				<p>I passed a few pairs of cyclists going in the opposite direction. None stopped. I didn't blame them. The rain and hills were not too conducive to chatting. However, at a spectacular viewpoint surrounded by sculpted mountains, two cyclists had stopped. I stopped. They were a couple from Sweden. We talked about the rain. They said there would be better weather in Sweden. They noticed my Ikea bag. We talked about the tunnel ahead. They didn't want to go through it and were hoping for an alternative. I realised the alternative was a 300m climb so I went through it.</p>
				
				<p>At the other end of the tunnel was better weather and a picnic spot with a toilet. I really appreciate all the people who clean and maintain tourist toilets. I've made use of quite a few along the way. I had second breakfast and a nice cup of tea.</p>
				
				<p>The weather was better on this 
				section of the coast. My shoes 
				started to dry. The scenery was 
				beautiful. I made it to &Oslash;rnes 
				in plenty of time for the ferry so 
				visited the Coop and the made myself 
				some fried egg sandwiches. On the 
				ferry I met Claudia from Germany who 
				was cycling, skiing, kayaking and 
				generally adventuring her way around 
				Norway. We talked with a retired 
				Norwegian policeman who seemed quite 
				taken with our travels.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry ended at Vassdalsvik which turned out just to be a ferry terminal and little else. I said goodbye to Claudia and headed on. Around into the next fjord provided some beautiful views as I stayed on the edge of the sun and rain. I was treated to a rainbow against the northern side of the fjord. The southern side of the fjord involved a bit more of a climb before heading down to Fur&oslash;y. I had been going to stop at the campsite here but my timing was impeccable and the ferry had just unloaded. I asked the ticket seller if there was anywhere to camp on the next section. She said there was a lake named Agvatnet. That settled it. I took the ferry to &Aring;gskardet and headed up to the lake.</p>
				
				<p>The lake had spectacular views of mountains ahead. I put my tent up whilst it was dry and got talking to a group of Italians who were in three camper vans. I got to dust off my patchy Italian. They'd been fishing and I watched as they filleted the cod they'd caught. They were covering them in salt to preserve them and take them home. They said they'd last up to two years. The shared their beer and breadsticks with me. It is amazing what a difference it makes to be able to talk to people, in however limited a fashion, in their own language.</p>
				
				<p>My tent dried in the evening sunshine. After I'd had a spinach soup and egg sandwich it started to rain again. I retired to my tent for the night.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-04T21:00+0100 " datetime="2017-07-04T21:00+0100 ">Tuesday 04th Jul 2017 (20:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I arrived at Bod&oslash; in the early hours. Thankfully the ferry terminal had an indoor waiting area. I pushed together three chairs and tried to sleep. I woke around 9am and headed for the bike shop. It wasn't yet officially open but the mechanic, who didn't speak English, got to work on my bike and sorted out the gears for me. I'd now have the full 24 instead of 12 and wouldn't be hurting my thumb.</p>
				
				<p>With my bike back to tip top condition, I went into town. The tourist map advertised a pizza restaurant with an all-you-can-eat pizza and salad buffet lunch for 129 krones. Perfect. I spent a couple of hours eating.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, in the early afternoon I was off. Bod&oslash; has a pretty good bike lane out of the city. By mid afternoon I reached Saltstramun where there is a "malstr&oslash;m" caused by the tidal water flowing through a narrow channel. It was clearly a popular tourist attraction and it seems there are power boat trips into the whirlpools.</p>
				
				<p>After a waffle and cocoa (I'm pushing the boat out today), I was back into the ups and downs of the fjord edges. I feel as though most of Norway exists in the narrow (but long) patch of land between the sea and the mountains. With sea levels rising, I wonder what fraction of the population will have to move upwards.</p>
				
				<p>I still needed to get my 80 km done for the day. At 70 km I was nearly calling it a day but persisted onwards. Then the rain set in. There was nowhere appropriate to stop for the night. Everything was too steep, too bumpy, or right on the edge of a cliff. I pushed on through a tunnel. That gave me a break from the rain. </p>
				
				<p>Out through another tunnel I suddenly halted as I noticed a big waterfall falling away to the right. Another cyclist, a Frenchman, had also stopped here to take a photo. I decided I would camp up stream a little but the French cyclist was heading back down to fjord-level to camp. He was tired of the coastal weather and had seen enough mountains. He said he might go into Sweden for a break. He sped off down the hill whilst I pitched my tent in the rain. At least the rain kept the mosquitos at bay. I slept to the sound of the river below me.</p>
