				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-05-20T16:56:00+BST" datetime="2017-05-20T16:56:00+BST">Saturday 20th May 2017 (16:56 BST)</time></div>
				<p>The plan is still on. My <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/RTWbike/blog/2017001.html">previous post</a> described an idea for a route. Since then I've decided to cross the North Sea from Bergen to Orkney (or Aberdeen) rather than head to Oslo. It keeps me on the Atlantic coast more and I'd not fully appreciated just how long Norway was. With a month to go, I've now started getting everything together.</p>
				
				<p><h3> Clothing</h3></p>
				
				<p>One of my old Howies long-sleeved merino base layers has worn out. It did well as I had it for a few years before cycling across two continents with it. The holes are now just too big. Thankfully I still have one left with smaller holes. They are great as they wick the sweat, take a while to start to smell (thanks to the merino), keep my arms from getting sunburned, and somehow keep me warm or cool whichever is needed. Still, only having one will mean I smell more on this trip.</p>
				
				<p><h3> Camping </h3></p>
				
				<p>I'll be (hopefully) doing more camping than on the last two trips. I hope to keep to under &pound;20/day on this trip. As accommodation is always the largest expense, I'll be doing more wild camping - especially in the wilds of Norway/Scotland - to help keep costs down.  I'm still massively impressed by the USD8/day Parry - <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/RTWbike/blog/0039.html">who I met in Utah</a> - had spent crossing the US.</p>
				
				<p>I still have my camping gear from the previous trips which includes my trusty little DoE-approved 1-2 person tent (you'd have to be quite friendly for two). I've bought a new bike bag for the flight to Kirkenes as that will also double up as the ground sheet for my tent. I like things to have multiple uses if possible. I should probably invest in some new tent pegs as I've slowly lost or bent too many of the ones I had.</p>
				
				<p><h3> Electronics</h3></p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="images/kit_elec.png" alt="landscape" title="Electronic kit" /><figcaption>Electronic kit</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>On my first trip the biggest headache was my phone; it needed charging every single day. In 2015 I bought a new phone specifically to improve the battery life for the Liverpool to Istanbul trip. It worked. I can now get 2-7 days of life from my phone if I switch stuff off when I don't need it. Hopefully the EU roaming directive should kick in around 17th June so I should be able to use my UK mobile in Norway without paying crazy amounts. Unless Brexit has scuppered that.</p>
				
				<p>My camera is quite bulky but gives much better photos than my phone. I have two batteries for it and they last ages because they don't need to power a display screen (it is an SLR). I have a tiny USB charger for the batteries.</p>
				
				<p>My Garmin eTrex 20 GPS claims around 25 hours on 2 AA batteries and, in practice, that has meant 3 days of cycling. I have some rechargeable batteries but AA are really easy to buy in many countries.</p>
				
				<p>On the last trip I bought two USB battery packs, on the road, which proved to be really useful and meant I wasn't always searching for a power outlet. I've bought another USB battery pack with a higher capacity to add to those. I've also decided to increase my power generation so, as well as the roll up Bear Grylls solar panel I bought in Nebraska, I have a new RavPower fold-up solar panel. I should be fine for power.</p>
				
				<p>I've purchased a &pound;7 on-the-go SD card reader which will mean I can now transfer photos off my camera onto my phone. Previously I've had to wait until I've found someone kind enough to let me use their computer to do that. I'll be self-sufficient now. I'll also be able to backup my GPS tracks onto my phone. </p>
				
				<p><h3> Bike</h3></p>
				
				<p>I replaced my gears on my bike a few months ago so they should be OK. The Schwalbe Marathon Plus tyres were new on before crossing Europe in 2015 so will hopefully last a good few thousand more miles. As long as they last me to Scotland I'll be happy. They are excellent tyres. I will need to get some new brake pads (and spares for Norway) as well as a couple of spare inner tubes. I'm wondering if I should take some spare spokes this time in case bike shops are even more spaced out than in the American west.</p>
				
				<p><h3> Flights</h3></p>
				
				<p>My flights to Kirkenes are booked. I fly on 16th June. I just need to add my bike on as excess baggage for an extra &pound;30. I am still trying to decide if I should book a flight from Bergen at the moment or wait until I have a better idea how long Norway will take to cycle once I've experienced it.</p>
				
				<p><h3> Getting ready</h3></p>
				
				<p>I really can't afford to pay &pound;1800 rent whilst I'm away so I've given my notice to my landlord. It'll be much cheaper to put everything in storage. It'll mean I have to find somewhere to live again when I return. That is a problem for then.</p>
				
				<p>I still need to sort out specialist travel insurance, sort out travel money, get my mapping sorted, and pack up my home. I'm also signed up to do my first triathlon in three weeks time so the next month will be busy. The nervousness, the excitement, and the anticipation are building. I'm looking forward to it.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017001.html">A new start</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-04-20T22:18:00+BST" datetime="2017-04-20T22:18:00+BST">Thursday 20th Apr 2017 (22:18 BST)</time></div>
				<p>In 2014 and 2015 I followed Thomas Stevens' cycle rides of 1884 and 1885 across the US and Europe. At Istanbul I said goodbye and wished him well on his trip around the world (130 years in the past). Now, two years later I've decided to set out on a new adventure.</p>
				
				<p>Whilst crossing Europe in 2015 I was interested to find out about the Eurovelo routes that criss-cross the continent. One of them caught my eye particularly. It was <a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-1">Eurovelo-1</a> and it described itself as the "Atlantic Coast Route". I've always been attracted to the rugged Atlantic Coast. I'm not really sure why. I grew up about as far from the coast as you could be in the north of England. Unfortunately, Eurovelo-1 doesn't quite stay true to the coast. It cuts off some of the best bits of Scotland and heads across the middle of the Iberian peninsula. If I was going to cycle the Atlantic coast of Europe, I was going to keep to the coast as much as possible.</p>
				
				<p>Last year, once my fears about geo-politics came true, I realised I'd have to get a move on and do this trip in 2017 if it was going to happen at all. So, the plan became more urgent. Eurovelo-1 is billed as 5000 miles so it will be longer than the US (4293 miles in 99 days) and Europe (2888 miles in 60 days). I'm giving myself between 3 and 4 months to do it in.</p>
				
				<p>The plan (at the moment) is to fly to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=9/69.7329/30.0751">Kirkenes, Norway</a> some time around mid June and get to the northern-most point of Norway for the Summer Solstice. Then follow the coast all the way to Oslo. At that point I need to somehow get across to Aberdeen (TBD). I then follow the coast of Scotland up to John O'Groats and around the west coast before getting the <a href="http://www.kintyreexpress.com/ferry%20service.html">ferry from Campbeltown to Ballycastle</a> (bikes are free!). Then around the coast of Northern Ireland (taking in Giant's Causeway) and the Republic of Ireland to Rosslare. There I take a ferry over to Fishguard, cycle the south Wales coast and around Devon and Cornwall (via Land's End). Then I'll probably take a ferry from Plymouth to Roscoff in Brittany before cycling down the west coast of France to Spain. At this point I may end up on the northern route of the Camino de Santiago. I'll then cycle down through Portugal and back into Spain to reach the southern tip - Tarifa. After that I'll probably carry on to Gibraltar (because it isn't far) then fly back from Malaga (I can get a cheap flight home).</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="images/2017route.png" alt="landscape" title="A vague plan" /><figcaption>A vague plan</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>That is the plan. It is deliberately less of a planned itinerary than I had on the last two trips. This time it'll be my own route and timings rather than those of a man dealing with the roads of 130 years earlier. I'll be able to adapt more. It'll be sad not to have Stevens as my guide but I'll take him along with me for this new adventure.</p>
				
				<p>Two months and counting.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-07-01T15:00:00+CEDT" datetime="2015-07-01T15:00:00+CEDT">Wednesday 01st Jul 2015 (15:00 CEDT)</time></div>
				<p>In the morning I left the hostel and set off to find the Hagia Sofia. My first knowledge of it was as a wonder of the world in the computer game Civilization, and I'd been looking forward to finally seeing it in person.</p>
				
				<p>In the tourist area, two Brits and then a nice lady from Melbourne asked me if I was from Yorkshire; it was written in big letters on my Grand D&eacute;part 2014 top. I took the opportunity to visit one of the gift shops near the Blue Mosque to find a sticker for my bike. Through Serbia and Bulgaria it had been extremely difficult to find stickers but here I managed to find an entire sheet thanks to the shop keeper even if he was confused as to why I wanted to put them on my bike. As I was adding the stickers, the lady from Melbourne came back over to talk to me and then some Italians wanted their picture with me. The crowd caused more people to come over to see what was going on. I was becoming a bit of a tourist attraction in my own right!</p>

				<p>I pushed my bike over towards the Hagia Sofia. I wasn't in a rush. I'd originally set with the intention of crossing the US and, whilst coming down from the Rockies had decided to follow Stevens across Europe too. I was finally here. I had cycled aross two continents and, as someone on Twitter pointed out, an entire religion. I had a content smile on my face. It has been fun following you Thomas. Enjoy the rest of your ride to Japan (1885-6). This is where <em>my</em> journey ends.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015057.html">Navigating from Silivri to Istanbul</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-30T21:00:00+CEDT" datetime="2015-06-30T21:00:00+CEDT">Tuesday 30th Jun 2015 (21:00 CEDT)</time></div>
				<p>In Stevens' day he said the morning calls to prayer woke him at 5am. They seem to be at 3.30am for me. Given that I'm in the same place as Stevens on the same day of the year, I suspect it was actually &#x130;msak (a call two hours before dawn to awaken the faithful). I turned over and got a few more hours sleep. I had a quiet breakfast on the rooftop breakfast bar.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19434773056"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/504/19434773056_2a7166621b.jpg" alt="photo" title="Silivri rooftops at breakfast" /></a><figcaption>Silivri rooftops at breakfast</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I headed up the hill and out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silivri">Silivri</a>. This was my last day of riding. It was one I'd been dreading for weeks given all the scary stories from other long-distance cyclists about the danger of the roads into Istanbul. <a href="http://thenextchallenge.org/tips-for-cycling-into-istanbul/">One website with advice for the route from Silivri into Istanbul</a> basically boiled down to "Just stick as close to the south coast as possible and enjoy." I tried to follow that advice even though sometimes following the closer road to the sea meant a dead-end and back tracking. </p>
				
				<p>I only had about 30 miles to go but, given that it is a major world city, I'd set aside the entire day. Having cycled through San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, London, Paris, Munich, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, and Sofia I knew I was lucky if I maintained a 6 mph pace in big cities. Istanbul was going to be slower as all the land traffic going from Europe to Asia was being funnelled into the crossing of the Bosphorus strait.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19274718349"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/483/19274718349_e5e510a0af.jpg" alt="photo" title="Coastline" /></a><figcaption>Coastline</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Up on the top of the hill I could see a long way. My destination felt within reach.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CIuvueiUEAUg0kk.jpg:large" alt="landscape" title="View towards Istanbul" /><figcaption>View towards Istanbul</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>From the map I knew I'd have to hug the coastline around two big bays (B&uuml;y&uuml;k&ccedil;ekmece G&ouml;l&uuml; and K&uuml;&ccedil;&uuml;k&ccedil;ekmece G&ouml;l&uuml;) where all routes came together at pinch points to cross narrow isthmuses. Those were the bits I was worried about. I came around the headland and saw the huge bay at B&uuml;y&uuml;k&ccedil;ekmece G&ouml;l&uuml;. Down towards the isthmus I went. I found unfinished, seafront, roads that had had a great deal of effort put into and then seemingly left incomplete. It meant I had a nice quiet stretch.</p>

				<p>I made it across the isthmus avoiding much of the need to go on the D100 by using footpaths and getting off and pushing along a temporary 'footpath' that was on the D100 due to building works. At this point my map told me the D100 was called the "Londra Asfalti". It was pleasing to think I'd actually cycled all the way from its ostensible destination.</p>
				
				<p>I continued to hug the coast and found a lovely, blue, bike lane through a sea-side resort. I had an icecream stop to cool down. I rejoined the lovely bike lane and followed it at a leisurely pace for a few miles around the bay. I was making the most of it as I knew it was unlikely to go all the way to Istanbul. </p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19454549962"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/402/19454549962_ab1c4ddb71.jpg" alt="photo" title="A bike lane!" /></a><figcaption>A bike lane!</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>At the headland I met more road works and a new port building under construction. I had to head up a steep hill to find a road. I was going through little sea-side villages on very quiet roads. It was very pleasant.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19273361630"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/301/19273361630_f37ab6a157.jpg" alt="photo" title="Allah" /></a><figcaption>Allah</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At one point up on the headland I got asked for directions! What is it about me that says I'm likely to know the way? My Yorkshire top? The loaded bike? I tried to explain that I wasn't from around here and they should probably ask one of the locals.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19434871266"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/452/19434871266_c56b3f12f0.jpg" alt="photo" title="Ships waiting" /></a><figcaption>Ships waiting</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>I was coming around to the second bay at K&uuml;&ccedil;&uuml;k&ccedil;ekmece G&ouml;l&uuml;. I stuck to the closest roads to the coast but there was a new housing estate and the road took me to the back of a port complex. I couldn't continue that way. I was a bit stuck. I back-tracked up a steep hill and took the next nearest road. As I came down the hill into the bay on &#x130;hlas Caddesi, I got dumped onto a busy multi-carriageway road. It became apparent that this was the front-entrance to the port and so clearly the wrong direction. I stopped at the side of the road next to a car that had accidentally come this way too. There was no way of turning around at this point when you realised your mistake. A security guard by the port gates tried to encourage me to go across the central reservation and cycle back along the other side. Given that would mean crossing up to six lanes of crazy traffic that wouldn't be expecting a person on a bicycle I shook my head lots and said I'd walk back along the side I'd come along. A few minutes later the car driver followed me down the narrow hard-shoulder against the flow of traffic too.</p>
				
				<p>I was stuck back on &#x130;hlas Caddesi. Should I take a fly-over and use the busy dual carriageway? A couple of security guards who were standing around seemed to think this was my only way into Istanbul. Across the flyover I went for the start of my own <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/details.php?id=1090">seven minutes of terror</a>.</p>
				
				<p>I joined the dual carriageway. It looked suspiciously like a motorway even though it was marked as a normal road on OpenStreetMap and Google Maps. I didn't want to be on a busy motorway amongst speeding cars with virtually no hard shoulder. My knuckles were going white. Another road - Osmangazi Caddesi - joined from the right. I may have had right-of-way by normal road rules but Istanbul drivers didn't seem like the sort who would stop or slow down to let me across the slip lanes. I just stopped at the point where the two roads joined and waited for a suitable gap then peddaled like crazy to get across. The ordeal wasn't quite over. I had to leave the pitiful hard shoulder for several trucks and cars that seemed to have been parked in them. Each time I had to move out into the inside lane I gripped my handlebars ever tighter. </p>
				
				<p>I took the road off onto Haramidere Ambarli Yolu which was a quieter (although still far from quiet) road. The traffic was slower here and I could breath a bit more. My heart rate started to come back down. </p>
				
				<p>At the end of Haramidere Ambarli Yolu a man in a white van stopped to say hello in Turkish and tell me that the road I'd been on wasn't so safe! With the customery hand waving, I explained that I'd cycled all the way from Liverpool (most people have heard of Liverpool due to Liverpool F.C.). He was impressed with the route and told me to follow him up the road so he could buy me a cola and give advice on which roads to avoid. He didn't genuine and I supressed all the years of being told not to go with strangers. Actually, as it turned out, he followed <em>me</em> up the road. He had decided to act as a shield to protect me from all the drivers behind. What a lovely white van man! </p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19274811079"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3732/19274811079_91c613f2ec.jpg" alt="photo" title="White van man" /></a><figcaption>White van man</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Along the road, my new friend waved me over and parked up his van. He ran off and came back with a can of cola for me to celebrate the end of my trip. He told me to stick to the small roads and wished me well as he ran off to a nearby building to continue his day's work. </p>
				
				<p>We often think of strangers as dangerous people to be avoided and treated with suspicion. What the ride from San Francisco has shown me time and time again is that most people are friendly and kind. Although they don't know you and have entirely different politics and religions, they see the magnitude of the trip you've undertaken and want to help. Cycle touring has shown me some of the kindness humanity - all of humanity - is capable of. </p>
				
				<p>I got back down to the coast and I found more bright blue bike lane through Avc&#x131;lar Sahil Park&#x131;. Around a third, smaller, bay I got squashed between the D100 and more road works. I followed the parks around the coast south of the airport and got a good view of the entrance to the Bosphorus a few miles away. Hello Istanbul!</p>

				<p>I now had run out of coastal park and had to rejoin the roads. The land between the main road - Sahil Yolu - and the coast seemed to be private or military so I had to go along the partial footpath along the side of it. This part wasn't so enjoyable. The road turned into Kennedy Caddesi and I did get more bike lane even if it did tend to disappear into walls and building work. It seems the city don't think it necessary to provide alternatives for bicycles when they close a route. Istanbul cycling can be quite stressful when the bike lanes stop.</p>

				<p>The final stretch involved quite a bit of pushing along the footpaths when they existed rather than deal with the rush-hour traffic. I was slightly surprised at one junction when I saw a 10 year old boy cycling amonst the traffic. He was clearly more used to Istanbul drivers than I was.</p>
				
				<p>I got off Kennedy Caddesi and into the old town. The roads were narrow and bendy and I felt a lot more comfortable. I checked into a hostel. After around 7000 miles of cycling, I had reached my final destination. Time for a shower.</p>
