				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-140T21:42:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-140T21:42:00+0200">Wednesday 13th May 2015 (22:42 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It rained through the night so in the morning I did my best to dry my tent. Clotilde lent me their foot pump to get my tyres back to pressure. Once they were packed up they set off on their impressive tandem and trailer. I left a couple of minutes behind them. By 10.30 I was in Mantes-la-jolie and once again decided to over-rule my GPS and go the quieter roads. These proved hilly but pleasant and helped by the courteous drivers. In Maule I happened to glimpse Clotilde and Pierre in a bus shelter. I stopped and joined them for lunch. They had just boiled up some minestrone. It was so nice to meet them again. After lunch our paths really did diverge as I headed fort Saint Germain and they went more south.</p>

				<p>On the outskirts of Saint Germain I stopped at a shopping centre for free WiFi and to buy a plug adapter (needlessly it would turn out because I had my worldwide one with me and had forgotten about it). It was at this point that the long threatened rain finally came. Thankfully I was under shelter.</p>
				
				<p>After the deluge had abated I set off again through the charming Saint Germain end Laye. Over the river again I ignored my Gps's claim of 45 miles and went along a pleasant riverside bike path. It eventually turned into quiet, one-way Road. I was going the wrong way but the signs said "sauf velos" so I was OK. It explained why my GPS wasn't happy. Back over the bridge I was hoping to get into Paris before the rush hour. I may have been helped by a public holiday as it was fairly quiet and much easier riding than London.</p>
				
				<p>I reached Port Maillot and then another mile to the Arc de Triomphe for an obligatory photo opportunity. Here I got a crepe with Nutella for two-thirds the price of one on Brighton pier.</p>

				<p>Today was an early start as Pierre and Marie had to take the children to school. As I had to visit Thomas Stevens' locations I had to go back over the Seine to Elbeuf then I tried my best to stay on small, quiet, roads (all very well paved) where possible through Gaillon to Vernon. My knee seemed to be bearing up surprisingly well. Pierre and Marie's magic cream must have helped. </p>

				<p>At Vernon I decided to jump to the other side of the Seine where the map showed a cycle path even if my GPS really didn't want to route me that way. Ignoring its protestations the route was great.</p>

				<p>In trying to find accommodation for the night, Google Maps was only showing expensive options. The reason for this became obvious when I arrived in Giverny home of Claud Monet. It is now a tourist trap and half the voices in the little Street were American. With a small daily budget I limited myself to just visiting Money's house and garden rather than the Impressionist Museum too. The flower and water gardens were particularly fragrant and pretty.</p>
				
				<p>Leaving the flowers behind I headed for  a campsite Les Groux which had looked like being €20 online but the friendly lady at reception only charged me €10 as I was alone and without a car.</p>
				
				<p>After pitching my tent I met Leonard and Clotilde who were cycling on a tandem from Rouen to Versailles as a practice for cycling to the south of France later in the summer. They gave me more magic pomade for my knee and told me about their ride from Edinburgh to Brighton last year. It was great to talk to them and helped cheer me up some more. A large fraction of long distance cycling is the mental attitude and a combination of my knee pain and the worry over languages, money, and the difficulties ahead had been affecting me. Since New Haven I'd decided to limit my sights to Paris as I could get the train home from there if I felt terrible.</p>

				<p>Cycling out of Dieppe so early in the morning sun meant little traffic and a gentle introduction to French road signs (advice on the signs from Janet helped). I had a few miles of fast A-road equivalent and then I hit more rural roads. As Thomas Stevens experienced, the roads in Normandy are well paved and a pleasure to ride on. I hadn't expected the drivers to be as polite as they are. I haven't seen such politeness since the western states of the US.</p>

				<p>By late morning I reached Cleres and purchased some cheese, fruit and bread from the lovely local shops. On back roads, following advice from an expat Brit I had amazing scenery. Through the Forêt Verte my knee was no fan of the hills but the scenery made up for it.</p>

				<p>I hadn't realised how high up I was and got a fabulous view of Rouen as I left the forest. My breaks were tested coming down the steep winding streets into Rouen and the Seine valley. I wasn't sure how long it would take to reach my kind hosts so I pressed onwards across the Seine. Through suburbs I was trying to find a bike-friendly bridge across a bend in the river rather than the autoroute that my GPS wanted me to use. Eventually I found one that crossed to an Idea and a retail park where I sat in McDonalds using the WiFi and toilets. </p>

				<p>As it got to 6pm I headed on to my hosts who would be back from work. They were the lovely Pierre and Marie and their two small children. They fed me, gave me a warm shower and gave me some strong topical cream for my knee. I slept on my camping mattress in their living room.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-120T07:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-120T07:00:00+0200">Monday 11th May 2015 (22:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I felt a little better with medication but went and bought a knee brace from Boots to see if that would help. I decided to make my way 
				along to New Haven to see how my knee felt. The coastline still 
				had some fog around but I got some nice views of the white 
				cliffs following NCN 2. I met a Frenchman on a bike cycling from 
				Dover along the south coast. He remarked that I didn't have much 
				luggage - the opposite of the Dutchman in Liverpool. </p>

				<p>I sped down 
				into New Haven and ended up in the town centre when I lost the 
				route signs. Still feeling sorry for myself I went into La 
				Baguette cafe to get a sandwich and tea. A short while later a 
				man came in and started talking to the proprietor about his 
				recent purchase of a Penny Farthing. That caught my attention. 
				His name was Mike and, along with the owner Graham, we chatted 
				about his bike, their local cycling and my trip. I'd really been 
				considering stopping and getting the train home but they gave me 
				the impetus to get to Paris. Graham recommended a book - 
				<em>Between the Woods and the Water</em> - and I sat in the library 
				opposite reading it until closing time. Then I trundled towards 
				the ferry terminal where I bumped into Janet - a 70 year old 
				cycle tourer going to the Pyrenees then Austria and the 
				Netherlands! We were both getting the 23:00 ferry so we kept 
				each other company with stories from our trips, advice from 
				Janet about the route, and general chit chat. By the time of the 
				ferry another 5 cyclists had turned up (3 in a group and 2 
				individuals). The advantage of the overnight ferry is no need to 
				pay for accommodation but the disadvantage is trying to sleep in 
				a chair for 5 hours.</p>
				
				<p>At 5am local time we arrived bleary-eyed. Janet, myself and another cyclist named Ian decided to ride into Dieppe together and wait for dawn We talked over coffee and, once we felt it was light enough, said our goodbyes and headed our separate ways. Ian was meeting a friend and Janet was - heading along the <em>Avenue Verte</em>.</p>
