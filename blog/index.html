				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-21T22:59+0100" datetime="2017-06-21T22:59+0100">Wednesday 21st Jun 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I had a very late start this morning. I laid in hoping the cold rain would stop so I could take down my tent. It eased and I slowly packed then had a big pot of porridge (with Nutella and banana as is now standard).</p>
				
				<p>I cycled into town and tried to sort my brakes outside the Tourist information office before being slightly rudely asked to move by someone wanting to sell tours to tourists disembarking from the Hurtigruten. One American lady came up to me and earnestly asked me if there was WiFi. Another couple asked me where they could find an ATM. Once again I was stood with a heavily loaded bike and was mistaken for a local.</p>
				
				<p>I went to the Coop to get food for the next couple of days and was stunned to find a little jar of pesto for 4.90 NOK. I thought they may have put the decimal point in the wrong place given Norwegian prices. They hadn't. Bargain! </p>
				
				<p>I then hit the road proper and reached my first tunnel. This one was 4km long. It was noisy, especially when cars or camper vans or tourist buses went by. But it was easier than I thought. Plus it was flat.</p>
				
				<p>A few kilometres after that one I got to a second. This was the big one; 6870m of road that went under the sea to the mainland. It was 3km down, a kilometre of flat, then 3km uphill. At the lowest it was 212m below sea level.</p>
				
				<p>On the mainland, the road was easier than the last few days. The rain was now intermittent and light. The cold north easterly had lessened a bit.</p>
				
				<p>Off in the distance I saw what looked like a figure on the road. It was! I stopped to find Brendan, an adventurous Australian, walking from Nordkapp to Oslo. Actually he started on a spit of last about 100m further north than Nordkapp. Realising I could have a proper conversation, I asked if I could walk with him for a bit. I pushed my bike and we chatted about our trips, our countries, and life. At some point he said he'd like to stop for a water break. I asked him if he'd like a cup of tea. He said yes so I produced my flask. I apologised for the lack of milk. It transpired that he had 20 days of food in his backpack but it was all in powdered form. So, I offered to make a fried egg sandwich. I wouldn't get top marks for presentation but sharing hot sandwiches and tea on the desolate side of a fjord was a simple pleasure. I also gave him a banana and some chocolate to keep him going. It is important to help out those in a tougher situation.</p>
				
				<p>Brendan is a pretty awesome person. He had saved for 10 years and has been travelling all over the world for over two years now. He has cycled through south East Asia and been to South America. I could have easily kept walking with him for the rest of the day but realised I'd taken a lot of his time so wished him well with a handshake and cycled on. Meeting people like Brendan is what makes these trips so enjoyable. </p>

				<p>I'd been roughly aiming for Olderfjord but, with 40km to go I saw a perfect little camping spot. Someone had fashioned a little table from stone among a rare group of trees. It had a view of the fjord. I pitched my tent. After dinner I was having tea and biscuits when two reindeer came into view. They hadn't seen me and gradually got closer grazing on the short Arctic plants. One kept staring in my direction trying to work out if I was a danger but must have finally decided I was part of the scenery. They got really close but we're finally scared off by a van that stopped on the road so the four male occupants could smoke, pee, and top up their petrol tank.</p>

				<p>A little later I was visited by a hardy bumble bee touring the diminutive plants and somehow making an existence for itself in the little sylvan nook.</p>
				
				<p>The weather wasn't perfect today but the friend on the road, the views, and the wildlife have made it one to remeber fondly.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-20T17:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-20T17:00+0100">Tuesday 20th Jun 2017 (16:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>The Hurtigruten arrived in Mehamn harbour a little late. There were three of us getting on. It was like a ghost ship but then it was 1am. I sat in a lovely comfy chair on the viewing deck and drifted between sleep and worrying that I'd missed my stop. At 5.30 we pulled into Honningsv&aring;g and bus loads of tourists disembarked to visit Nordkapp. I was the only bike getting off but not the only bike visiting the Cape today.</p>
				
				<p>I headed out of town and cooked myself two eggs and porridge (separately) by the side of a fjord. Then, about 8am, I headed up the road to Nordkapp. Up was the right word. There were a series of 200-300m climbs along the 25km road with snow and clagg above 200 or so metres again. This road was much busier than the past few days as camper vans, cars, and buses made their way to a point notable for being the northern-most point of Europe. </p>
				
				<p>The final 1 km had a big drop down to the ocean on the side. The exposure made me stick to the middle of the road in case of a gust of wind. Riding up the final 500m took me to a ticket booth where I was waved through because I'd arrived by a sustainable means of transport (it is free for walkers too). I headed to the globe monument and got a picture of my bike. I've taken its picture next to quite a few landmarks now.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCxeNN8XYAAlg0i?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Nordkapp" /><figcaption>Nordkapp</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I went into the visitor centre to warm up and dry off. Every layer of clothes was wet either from sweat or rain. I had an expensive cup of coffee and a plate-sized waffle. Then I visited the shop and panic bought a new waterproof jacket as mine is no longer doing the job (the past 24 hours have sure been expensive). I then went to watch the panoramic film about Nordkapp and visited the exhibition. Having somewhere to warm up at the end of the world was very welcome even if I didn't really dry out.</p>
				
				<p>Eventually I had to venture back out into the cold but now with an extra jacket. On the way back I knew what to expect of the road so it felt easier. At the end of the tough section, a few km from Honningsv&aging;g, I decided to stay in a campsite. It was expensive (210 NOK as it is in tourist land) but every piece of clothing I had seemed to be wet and I wanted the use of a dryer. I had really overspent today.</p>
				
				<p>I dried my clothes (20 NOK) and made full use of the kitchen. I chatted with a couple from The Netherlands who had cycled all the way from home.</p>
				
				<p>I may not have cycled far today but at least I was now warm, dry, and fed.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-19T23:14+0100" datetime="2017-06-19T23:14+0100">Monday 19th Jun 2017 (22:14 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I work to the sound of rain pattering on my tent at 6am and went back to sleep. At 8.30 it was still going on. I had to pack up my tent from the inside and head to the little kitchen to make breakfast. After another chat with the Swiss guy, I eventually got a late start. Had I not learned how hard progress is in Norway?</p>
				
				<p>I rode around fjords and over small hills. I wished I hadn't filled my 10 litre water carrier but I didn't want to run out. Although, that clearly wasn't likely today. At Lebesby I stopped to get a small coffee and waffle then bought food in the adjoining shop. A loaf of bread costs about &pound;3. The lady at the checkout told me the rain would last until Wednesday.</p>
				
				<p>I then headed on around the headland and along another fjord. Then the road started going up. There was a raised barrier that indicated this road could be closed in winter. Up I rode to snowy uplands like yesterday. Only this time it was raining and the clay was down to about 200 metres altitude. It got cold. I had no idea how long this stretch of upland would last. I couldn't even see a view. So much for this being the 'scenic' route. Eventually I saw a man up ahead. He was removing the red poles that mark the edge of the road in winter. He told me this was pretty much the top and that it would head down to Hopseidet before another upland stretch. He warned that snow was due tomorrow. The weather forecast had changed in 30km.</p>
				
				<p>Hopseidet turns out to be a little sliver of land that stops Halv &Ouml;ya being an island. It had a little toilet block that sat between two fjords. One toilet also had a radiator so I tried to dry my sodden gloves after wringing them out. So much for being waterproof. I made some sandwiches and some soup sat in the toilet doorway (it was still raining). At this point a little red car stopped and the driver asked if I was OK. He insisted he would go get me some "plastic gloves" and returned a few minutes later with some old industrial rubber gloves like you might use on a fishing trawler. He said the were to be a gift from SalMar. Thanks. </p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCtFOWCXsAEWipu?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="My glove benefactor" /><figcaption>My glove benefactor</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>My glove benefactor then suggested I head to Mehamn instead of Kjøllefjord as it was 12 km shorter. As I neared the top of the 240m hill he pulled up alongside me. It seems he wanted to check I was OK again even though it was the opposite direction for him. I thanked him and headed on. About 19km of cold rainy clang on, I reached a fork in the road. Even the rubber gloves had started to get cold water in them so I headed to Mehamn. It would cost me double on the Hurtigruten ferry but I wasn't sure I'd survive the cold otherwise.</p>
				
				<p>I saw a "Mehamn 9km" sign and then the real downhill started. That made me happy but it also meant a chilling wind from the speed.</p>
				
				<p>I rolled into Mehamn and saw a shop was open. They were advertising ice-cream and a "brain freezer". It mostly sold chilled items. I walked out in search of something warm. I found a Coop and bought food for tomorrow then headed to the Hurtigruten port. There I found a warm little waiting room. It was empty. I put my clothes on the back of chairs and my shoes on a radiator to dry out. I slowly started to thaw.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry is at 1am. There is nobody here so I don't know what to do about a ticket. The website doesn't seem to have an option for bikes. I shall wait in the hope a person turns up at the little office. My daily budget is well and truly blown today (by a factor of four) but at least I don't have frostbite.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017006.html">To Ifjord</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-18T22:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-18T22:00+0100">Sunday 18th Jun 2017 (21:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I sleep better on night two but still don't get a full night's sleep. I have porridge with banana and Nutella for breakfast then pack up and start off at 10am.</p>
				
				<p>Overnight I downloaded Open Street Map for Norway for the Orux Maps app that I still have from Osijek in Croatia. That gives me a map at least even if not on my Garmin. One step at a time.</p>
				
				<p>I cycle to the end of the fjord, by a small 
				village, and on to Varangerbotn. I'd been 
				hoping to get some food there but it is 
				small and everything is shut. Ah, of 
				course! It's Sunday. So I head on to Tana 
				Bru where everything is closed apart from a 
				MAX which is a shop/motel. I order a 
				chicken pannini and a small portion 
				of chips which comes to around &pound;8.50! 
				As everyone says, Norway is expensive.</p>
				
				<p>After lunch I head north along another fjord. I finally see a sign that tells me it is 80km to Ifjord where I thought I'd aim for today. The route bends westward and I climb over hills and down to another fjord. Then up hills and down to another. Then up a hill that seems to keep going up and takes me to the snow covered uplands. I see reindeer. They ignore the cars and buses so much so that drivers have to honk their horns to get them to move. Meanwhile a bicycle is so unusual (especially one with a singing human) that they all scarper in fright as I get anywhere near.</p>
				
				<p>The snowy tops seem to keep going on and on. I remind myself not to be worried about the sun going down (it won't) but I do wonder if the weather might turn. I wouldn't want to be stranded up here in a blizzard. Eventually the serious downhill starts and I get to experience the joy of speeding down an empty, well surfaced, winding road singing at the top of my voice (I started doing this in America to scare off bears but it is now a habit).</p>
				
				<p>Ifjord turns out to be tiny but it has a campsite.  Despite the 180 krones cost for a tent pitch, I'd quite like a shower and washing facilities so I check in. As I wash my dishes a Swiss man, touring Scandinavia in a camper van, asks me about my bike and trip. He says the snow I encountered was unusually late this year. Afterwards, a Swedish man chats to me in a mix of English,  Swedish, and German. He mainly seems to be asking about my brakes and gears as he saw me in Tana Bru and wonders how I got up over the snowy plateau.</p>
				
				<p>It has been another good but tiring day. Given the slow going, I may follow Canute's advice from yesterday and adjust my route. Rather than go south around a huge fjord, I will go north to Kj&oslash;llefjord then take the Hurtigruten ferry to Honningsv&aring;g. If I get the 3am ferry (one per day) on 20th, I should make the Solstice at Nordkapp. </p>
