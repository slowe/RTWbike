				<p>I left from central Warrington at about 9.20 am and made my way out onto the Knutsford Road (45 casualties said the red sign).I reached Knutsford by 10.30 and was met by my friend Peter who had arrived by car to visit the Knutsford Penny Farthing Museum.</p>
				
				<p>The museum was hidden away in a courtyard and was run by a man who had cycled from San Francisco to Boston on a penny farthing 20 years ago. Unfortunately, he wasn't in today but we got to see their collection and had a hearty breakfast.</p>

				<p>At Knutsford I said goodbye to Peter and continued on over Cheshire lanes to Jodrell Bank home of the mighty Lovell Telescope. I'd spent a few years working there so I was on lanes I knew. I stopped at the new Visitor Centre to see it and have a nice, relaxing, cup of tea. With it being a Sunday none of the people I knew were around and some had retired but I had a good chat with Jill and Soliyta. Over tea I also got talking to two cyclists -Chris and Owen - who were organising a charity ride from Edinburgh to London in July.</p>
				
				<p>Heading on from Jodrell, out beyond the Red Lion at Swettenham, I stopped for a chat with David who was cycling to Sandbach.</p>

				<p>I pressed on beyond the area I knew to Congleton where I picked up the lovely Biddulph Valley Way cycle trail. It slowly ascended upwards along a wooded track but with occasional views of lambs lazing in the sunshine. The weather had been mixed this morning but had stayed dry this afternoon.</p>
				
				<p>Around Stoke-on-Trent I had some tricky points on National Cycle Network where the gates became impossible to get through with panniers and a very steep hill. In the middle of Stoke-on-Trent there was some confusing routing but I managed to hit the canal trail along to Stone where I was staying with the wonderful Taylors. Gordon had ridden across America, bits of Canada, and lots of Europe so was a wealth of stories and information. They were excellent hosts and made a great fish pie for dinner.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015002.html">Leaving of Liverpool</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-02T19:20:00+0100" datetime="2015-05-02T19:20:00+0100">Saturday 02nd May 2015 (18:20 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I started out from New Brighton where I dipped my wheel in the sea and my dad waved me off. Along the front in the rain I found the famous Ferry Across the Mersey. Whilst waiting I talked to some lightweight tourers who told me that my bike was too heavy. I said I should be fine having done this before.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry turned out to be a 40 minute cruise up and down the Mersey so I arrived at All Saints church at Edge Hill 20 minutes late. Awaiting me was my friend Peter who was going to accompany me out to Warrington much as the Anfield Bicycle Club had with Thomas Stevens 130 years ago.</p>

				<p>Just like Stevens, we were heading along Edge Hill Road and the capricious British weather threw wind and rain at us. We manage to catch a section of National Cycle Network along and old train line which was much more pleasant than city roads. As we left Liverpool we  took in views both rural and industrial along the Wirral.</p>

				<p>With the light starting to fade we made it in to Warrington.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-02T10:40:00+PDT" datetime="2015-05-02T10:40:00+PDT">Saturday 02nd May 2015 (10:40 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>After having completed the US leg of Thomas Stevens' journey, I am about to embark on the second. This will follow his route from Liverpool, England to Istanbul, Turkey. He had arrived in Liverpool on April 19 by ship from New York. He set off from Edge Hill church at 4pm on Saturday May 2nd. That is today. My dad is about to give me a lift over to Liverpool. I will try to update my blog more this time but otherwise I will <a href="https://twitter.com/rtwbike">still be on Twitter</a>.</p>
