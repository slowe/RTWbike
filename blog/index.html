				<p>The rash has been slowly going down. So I'm back on the road after a very long sleep last night.</p>
				
				<p>Today sees me visit the northernmost point in Spain but also has a sapping number of hills.</p>

				<p>I looked north across the Bay of Biscay. Over there was Ireland and Mizen Head where I was just a month ago.</p>
				
				<p>As I got back to the car park I heard someone say "there's a Yorkshire tshirt". I met Ian and Jean. Jean is from Sheffield. It turns out they had first met in Burley-in-Wharfdale. It is a small world. We had a nice chat. They have been trying to spot Spanish bears. That worried me but Ian insisted they are very rare and shy.</p>

				<p>As I stopped to consult a map in Cedeira, a black cat crossed my path and looked expectantly at me. I think it thought I was its human as a man turned up on a bicycle and, realising its error, ran over to him.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DK_KzzKXkAAW-Ip.jpg" alt="landscape" title="Finally the air felt fresher as I rounded the top of Spain." /><figcaption>Finally the air felt fresher as I rounded the top of Spain.</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At this point my breathing suddenly felt easier. My cold symptoms were still there but my ungs felt better. I started to wonder if it was hayfever from some plant in this region. Now that I was rounding the coast the prevailing winds would be bringing me ocean air rather than air from the land. Fingers crossed that that was the source of the cold.</p>
				
				<p>I had been heading for a campsite on the coast but realised that would be another 179m hill (which I'd have to climb back over tomorrow) and I felt I should try to reduce the number of kilometres I had planned for tomorrow. So I headed on to Ferrol. The next campsite was going to be 2 hours cycle further which would make it near sunset. So, I chickened out and treated myself to a hotel. It turned out that paying in person it was cheaper than on the popular booking websites. Either that or the &pound; is having issues.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-09-29T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-09-29T23:59+0200">Friday 29th Sep 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I have a head cold and an itchy rash on my feet, legs, and arms. :(</p>
				
				<p>I probably need to find a public health centre (EHIC) but can't navigate <a href="https://t.co/eUXIwharQx"></a> I'm in Viveiro.</p>
				
				<p>I took an antihistamine last night but it hasn't helped.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DK4B-x-WsAAfchh.jpg" alt="landscape" title="Rash" /><figcaption>Rash</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I'm hoping it is hives from the exertion of the past three days.</p>
				
				<p>I visited the local public health centre. Quite understandably, nobody really spoke English (or French). Google translate was our friend.</p>
				
				<p>I'm glad I had my EHIC card with me. The only confusion was my US travel visa as it looks like a photo page so they thought I was American.</p>
				
				<p>But we managed to clear that up and get to the right page in my passport showing I was from the EU.</p>
				
				<p>I joined a queue to see a doctor. I only had to wait 10 minutes. She prescribed an injection and some antihistamines for the next 5 days.</p>
				
				<p>I then went downstairs where I was given two injections in my buttocks. It was Urbason. The second was quite painful and I got lightheaded</p>
				
				<p>The second doctor checked my blood pressure and I had a rest for a few minutes. She told me to take some juice or coffee with sugar.</p>
				
				<p>It is quite scary getting treatment when you can't really communicate because you don't know the language and people don't know yours.</p>
				
				<p>But credit to the Spanish health service for seeing to me quickly, professionally, and kindly. You realise how lucky we are in Europe.</p>
				
				<p>My EHIC card means the only cost to me was Euro 4.40 for the prescription. They also told me to rest as the pills would make me drowsy.</p>
				
				<p>So I checked into a cheap hotel. I'm going to eat and rest. Hopefully the rash will go down.</p>
				
				<p>All this is a reminder of the important care the folks at @MSF_uk provide to those in much harder situations <a href="https://t.co/KohIMIW8v3"></a></p>

				<p>I was getting jealous of the motorway this morning as it got to sail along keeping it's altitude whereas I had to go into every ravine.</p>
				
				<p>My left crank started to come off. Not sure why. I tightened it back on, as best as I could, with the huge Allen key on my little tool set. But, on seeing a bike shop by the side of the road, I decided I should get it tightened properly.</p>

				<p>After crossing the bridge at Ribadeo, I took some smaller roads. At one point a small yappy-type dog jumped out into the street and chased me, snapping at my heels. I did my usual of stopping and getting off my bike. It backed off but gave chase again when I remounted. Grr.</p>
				
				<p>I was heading to Praia das Catedrais where Luis from Santander had said I should visit.</p>

				<p>As I arrived at Praia das Catedrais, I saw two touring cyclists. Theye were <a href="http://rideloveandspain.wordpress.com/">Claudine and Bernard</a>. They were cycling from near Nantes, south around the coast of France, Spain, Portugal, and Spain. They were having lunch and this was where I'd planned to stop for lunch too. They invited me to join them. We had a nice long conversation, in French, over a late lunch. That GCSE in French has proved useful even if I've forgotten a lot.</p>

				<p>Afterwards, we went to a little cafe and they kindly bought me an espresso.</p>

				<p>I wished them "bon voyage" and pushed on. From this point I part ways with the Camino pilgrims. They head inland towards Santiago de Compostela. I stick to the coast. It will be sad to no longer see the walkers on the road. People will probably stop saying "buon Camino" to me.</p>
				
				<p>The last 50km of the day was a little harder. I had the start of a cold this morning and it got worse. I noticed that it was affecting my breathing. You know when you've got the start of a chesty cough coming on? That. I'm not sure excerising it off is a thing so I'll endeavour to eat plenty of fruit and veg in the hope that helps.</p>
				
				<p>I'd been slowly working through the elevation gain Google maps had suggested for today. I knew there was a 171m climb just near the end. I was dreading it even though it wasn't all that high compared to what I've been up. In the end it wasn't too steep. But I was glad to reach the top. From there I could glide down into Viviero and the campsite.</p>

				<p>Having ridden all day over many hills  I was disappointed to discover that the campsite I'd aimed for all day was closed. I headed back up to Soto de Lui&ntilde;a. I asked at one hotel. They said there was the Albergue but it was full and I wasn't a pilgrim. Their hotel rooms were &euro;35 but the lady said there might be someyhing cheaper in the middle. The bar in the centre had an Albergue. No go for me. I feel like a second class citizen. They sent me to another hotel. This was &euro;30 so I took it having no cheaper option. It has exceeded my daily budget but he upside is that I can have my first bath in 102 days.</p>
