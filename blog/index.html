				<h2 class="title"><a href="0039.html">Ogden and South Weber</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-15T23:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-15T23:00:00+PDT">Thursday 15th May 2014 (23:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I woke at 7am and was greeted by a noisy convoy of cars from the Utah Department of Conservation. I hadn't slept well and was still bleary-eyed. Once again I had to let my tent dry from the condensation during the night. I'll be glad when the temperature doesn't drop below freezing or the dew point at night.</p>
				
				<p>I'd been offered a bed for the night in South Weber by a long-distance cyclist named Parry. Actually he'd offered for me to stay with his parents and they were busy until 4.30 so I could take my time today heading south.</p>
				
				<p>I was quite chuffed to cycle by fruit orchards just as Thomas Stevens had done 130 years previously. I stopped at one point to call my dad to let him know about the last few days. He told me he'd been doing the journey with "the Google man" and told me how the road to Corinne kept going for miles. I told him I knew that as I'd just done it in real life! My dad seems to have really taken to Google Street View and was checking if I'd seen all the things he'd noticed or that he couldn't make out.</p>

				<p>I visited the US Post Office to send some postcards and mused over the fact that Americans send mail at the Post Office but we sent post by Royal Mail. Two countries separated by a common language.</p>
				
				<p>Near Ogden I found a pleasant river trail but had to back track as it seemed to be a dead end. After a trip to a store to find freeze-dried camping food I headed back to the river and then through Ogden proper which seemed to have an old-style main street.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14193884922"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14193884922_9df381fcab_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Ogden" /></a><figcaption>Ogden</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Heading south there was a bit of a hill and then some busy roads. They weren't any worse than back home but were a bit scary after Nevada and wilderness. A downhill took me to a scary intersection with the I-84 where I had to be very careful at the exits to make sure nobody drove into me.</p>
				
				<p>I arrived at Parry's parents house. I was met by Parry's mum and his dad showed me his beehives in the garden. It turns out Utah is "The Beehive State". A little later Parry turned up. I had a most welcome shower, they put my clothes in an actual washing machine (!), and they gave me some food. We all went out to get pizza and bread and brought it back to enjoy in the garden along with their neighbour. Parry had done a coast-to-coast route and Vancouver to Mexico so had plenty of good tips. We had a good long chat. </p>
				
				<p>Getting a warm shower, fresh food and such warmth from strangers makes an amazing difference to a bike trip. The Higginsons are a lovely family and made me feel so much at home in Utah.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-14T18:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-14T18:00:00+PDT">Wednesday 14th May 2014 (18:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>After the last few days both my knees and my bike needed a rest. After a late breakfast at J&Ds, I cycled south to find a bike shop the National Park rangers had told me about yesterday. It was BC Outdoors and was run by Todd. </p>
				
				<p>My de-railleur cable was going and my brakes were squeaking so I asked Todd if he could have a look at it. As he looked it over he also found that the pedals were shaking (that had started two days before) and two spokes had gone on my rear wheel. Many more broken spokes and the wheel would collapse. During the repairs and conversation, Todd got a delivery of bikes so I helped him unload. He fixed my bike and threw in some replacement pedals for nothing. Feeling guilty I insisted that I buy something so got a spare gas canister for my primus stove. Thanks Todd. The repairs served me well.</p>
				
				<p>After a couple of hours with Todd I cycled on to Weber State Park where there was a campsite. Again I was the only person actually camping in a tent as everyone else had a massive RV. People in RVs rarely seem to talk to people in tents. Perhaps it is a social status thing.</p>
				
				<p>Weber (pronounced "wee-ber" not "webber") State Park is sandwiched between a man-made fresh water section of the Great Salt Lake and the I-84. It was very pretty but there was the constant sound of traffic from the interstate.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0037.html">From one frontier to another</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-13T21:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-13T21:00:00+PDT">Tuesday 13th May 2014 (21:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>Back when I was in San Francisco I visited the Stanford Museum with my friend Phil. In it they had the <em>golden spike</em> which was the ceremonial spike that joined the Union and Central Pacific railroads together. It was the first time the continent had been spanned and it was a momentous feat in the history of the young nation. It marked the taming of the frontier.</p>
				
				<p>I had followed the Central Pacific railroad all the way from Oakland and here I was at the end. There was even a National Park Visitor Center complete with two working steam engines! Oddly, the original meeting point of the railroads was going to be much further south near Ogden but, as the railroads were being paid by the US government by the mile, the companies added a few miles on for good measure.</p>
				
				<p>After a visit to the "restroom" and a long drink from the water fountain, I found the Rangers and asked for help with my broken pannier rack. They sent Ranger Phil to my rescue. He brought along some tools and we patched it up by attaching it to the second bolt hole on my frame. It meant the rack was a little twisted but it was good enough.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14196398385"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7438/14196398385_f053e9854d_c.jpg" alt="photo" title="Ranger Phil to the rescue" /></a><figcaption>Ranger Phil to the rescue</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Outside the centre I saw the two locomotives and got chatting to a couple of tourists from Boston (who said to look them up when I got there) and the engineer. The Bostonians said I should visit another landmark 10 or so miles south of here. By this point I'd got used to people in America underestimating distances due to being car drivers so I politely pointed out that would be at least a 20 mile detour. I said I'd leave it for my next visit.</p>

				<p>Inside I thanked the friendly National Park rangers for their help with my bike and had a good chat with them. They had a replica of the golden spike in a glass case. It was a slightly weird situation to have cycled from the original golden spike to Golden Spike to see a replica of the golden spike. Weird but strangely pleasing.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14009806437"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7345/14009806437_71c01d512c_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Friendly National Park rangers with the replica golden spike at Golden Spike" /></a><figcaption>Friendly National Park rangers with the replica golden spike at Golden Spike</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>As I left, one of the rangers gave me a couple of cookies he'd baked to give me some calories for my trip. I also got to see the engineer moving one of the locomotives and even had to wait for it at a level crossing.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14009768320"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2923/14009768320_d3e68389b4_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Engine" /></a><figcaption>Engine</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I had an excellent, smooth, downhill stretch from Golden Spike down to the main highway. On the way I was passed by the Bostonian couple who beeped and waved encouragement as they sped off.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14196338914"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5238/14196338914_f8d430372a_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Leaving Golden Spike" /></a><figcaption>Leaving Golden Spike</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At the highway I vaguely remembered a friend from back home telling me there was a rocket display somewhere out here in Utah. As I stood at the junction a cyclist came towards me and stopped to see what I was doing out here. It turned out he worked up the road and this was his commute home. He knew of the rocket display and told me it was less than two miles up the road. This was a cyclist telling me the distance so I believed him and went for a look. He was spot on. The display was outside ATK and included a booster from the Space Shuttle. It was amazing to have gone from railroads and the wild west to spacecraft in a few short miles.</p>

				<p>Eighteen miles later I approached Corinne - the first town in 130 miles. On the outskirts the desert gives way to lush green fields. I had hit the incredibly fertile strip that runs along the western side of the Great Salt Lake. You can see why the Mormons made their home here. I also experience my first close driver for 1000 miles. In the UK people often pass too closely but I'd got used to the two or three feet that people in California and Nevada had been leaving.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14196409805"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/14196409805_2065f0c367_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Crops near Corrine" /></a><figcaption>Crops near Corrine</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At the gas station in Corinne I was told that they had no motels in town. At its height they'd had over 100 saloons and gambling houses but today I'd have to go on to Brigham City for accommodation. I did. I found a motel and got a 10% discount at J&D's diner next door. I had a shower and washed my clothes in it. This was becoming the routine. My backside was feeling the last two days. But I'd done it. I'd done the most remote section of my trip and survived.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0036.html">The Great Salt Lake and nervous cows</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-13T14:56:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-13T14:56:00+PDT">Tuesday 13th May 2014 (14:56 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>The saying goes that you should "take only photographs and leave only footprints". I left a little more than footprints the next morning as I needed the toilet. The emergency toilet paper from my sister proved useful. I made sure to bury everything.</p>
				
				<p>I set off from the ghost town of Kelton along the old railroad grade again. Once again the horizon was much further than it seemed. I reached the corner of a range of hills by about 11am and had second breakfast and "<a href="0031.html">saw the elephant</a>".</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14193103751"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7442/14193103751_2baa98d4c4_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Seeing the elephant!" /></a><figcaption>Seeing the elephant!</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>A little further along was an outcrop that went into the Great Salt Lake. Well, it would have done if there was any water in it. It was obviously a place where people brought their 4x4s to camp and drive around on the salt flats firing their guns at things.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="full"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14635360860"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2901/14635360860_0e29304cba_h.jpg" alt="panorama" title="Great Salt Lake" /></a><figcaption>Great Salt Lake</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I left my bike on the "shore" and clambered up to the top to take in the view. In the distance it looked like there may be water but it could have been a mirage. I'm amazed to see occasional bursts of colour in the desert and there were some purple flowers near the top of this outcrop. </p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14196324174"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7371/14196324174_446ff6712e_c.jpg" alt="photo" title="A splash of colour" /></a><figcaption>A splash of colour</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Back on the road I had fairly loose gravel and rocks. This is fine when it doesn't get to a centimetre or so of thickness as then steering becomes next to impossible.</p>
				
				<p>At Salt Wells there was a lovely causeway road across a beautiful wetland. On the other side I hit a gravel hill and didn't have the energy to pedal so had to push my bike up. </p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14216543063"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5119/14216543063_0e19d6d0d9_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Salt Wells" /></a><figcaption>Salt Wells</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At this point I became aware of a herd of cows. Most were on one side of the road and were edging towards me. I wasn't sure how agressive American cows would be so I stopped. Their shiftiness turned out to be because I'd inadvertently separated a calf from the herd. I was offended that they mistook me for a cougar or other predator so yelled at them that I was a human and waved the calf across the road. It finally took heed of my wild gesticulations and the herd retreated. I carried on only to have repeat performances three more times with herds ahead. </p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14009800717"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7341/14009800717_f73710914a_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Nervous cows" /></a><figcaption>Nervous cows</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I was very happy to cross a cattle grid and be finished with the nervous cows but then I heard a strange mooing sound. There were no cows though. Was I imagining it? Over the top of the hill I had a nice freewheeling section but it became clear the mooing was from my bike. Approaching a farm I had more uphill and I realised the sound was from my pannier rack. The left side bracked had sheared the bolt off with all the vibration of the last few days and it was rubbing on my tyre. I took the Ikea bag off and put it on my back. I braced the Ortleib bags and rack with the bunjees and continued. Pushing a bike is so much more thirsty work than riding and I was going through my water faster than the day before. Over the top of the hill I had a welcome freewheel down to paved road about a mile from the famous <em>Golden Spike</em>.</p>
