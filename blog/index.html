				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-03T21:03+0200" datetime="2017-10-03T21:03+0200">Tuesday 03rd Oct 2017 (19:03 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It turns out it was a good job I had decided to wait to book my flight back. It seems the airline I was going to use has just gone bankrupt. Good job I randomly decided to check the BBC news this morning to find out what is happening over in Catalonia.</p>
				
				<p>I was up before dawn (which is getting later) but took a long time to get ready so didn't start early.</p>
				
				<p>I found a supermarket and bought some food. As I returned to my bike I saw a man contemplating it with awe. He asked if I was cycling Europe or the world. I showed him a map of my route on my phone. He shhok his head in disbelief then left.</p>
				
				<p>I had lots of inlets to circumnavigate today. It reminded me of the fjords. If only there were ferries to short cut them.</p>

				<p>I stopped in a little square for lunch. As I made a ham sandwich a huge wasp decided to join me. It wouldn't leave despite my attempts to shoo it. Finally I resorted to spraying it with Smidge that I still had from Scotland. It didn't like Smidge and left me in peace.</p>

				<p>After 147 km I arrived in Cangas to find the hostel I'd been aiming for was shut even if the website said it was open. As far as I could tell, the nearby campsites aren't open on Tuesdays in October either. The Youth Hostel across the water in Vigo had no availability either. Apparently there is some seafood festival happening in Vigo today so the whole bay is packed with tourists.</p>
				
				<p>The first hotel I tried had put their prices up because of all the visitors. They sent me to try another, cheaper, hotel. The second had a bike friendly sign but we're full. However the nice lady in the reception rang around a couple of people she knows. The end result was that I'm paying &euro;20 to stay in a lady's apartment which she isn't in tonight for some reason I couldn't comprehend. On the plus side, I finally have access to a kitchen. Dinner consisted of rice, olives, tuna, and biscuits.</p>
				
				<p>I've had enough of 50km trips around inlets. There should be ferries over the next two.</p>
				
				<p>Tomorrow I should arrive in Portugal.</p>

				<p>The rash has been slowly going down. So I'm back on the road after a very long sleep last night.</p>
				
				<p>Today sees me visit the northernmost point in Spain but also has a sapping number of hills.</p>

				<p>I looked north across the Bay of Biscay. Over there was Ireland and Mizen Head where I was just a month ago.</p>
				
				<p>As I got back to the car park I heard someone say "there's a Yorkshire tshirt". I met Ian and Jean. Jean is from Sheffield. It turns out they had first met in Burley-in-Wharfdale. It is a small world. We had a nice chat. They have been trying to spot Spanish bears. That worried me but Ian insisted they are very rare and shy.</p>

				<p>As I stopped to consult a map in Cedeira, a black cat crossed my path and looked expectantly at me. I think it thought I was its human as a man turned up on a bicycle and, realising its error, ran over to him.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DK_KzzKXkAAW-Ip.jpg" alt="landscape" title="Finally the air felt fresher as I rounded the top of Spain." /><figcaption>Finally the air felt fresher as I rounded the top of Spain.</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At this point my breathing suddenly felt easier. My cold symptoms were still there but my ungs felt better. I started to wonder if it was hayfever from some plant in this region. Now that I was rounding the coast the prevailing winds would be bringing me ocean air rather than air from the land. Fingers crossed that that was the source of the cold.</p>
				
				<p>I had been heading for a campsite on the coast but realised that would be another 179m hill (which I'd have to climb back over tomorrow) and I felt I should try to reduce the number of kilometres I had planned for tomorrow. So I headed on to Ferrol. The next campsite was going to be 2 hours cycle further which would make it near sunset. So, I chickened out and treated myself to a hotel. It turned out that paying in person it was cheaper than on the popular booking websites. Either that or the &pound; is having issues.</p>
