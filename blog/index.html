				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-21T21:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-21T21:00:00+PDT">Wednesday 21st May 2014 (21:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I was up bright and early but couldn't set off and there was condensation in my tent so I waited for the sun to dry it out. There had been another tent on the site during the night - it was the first other tent I've seen so far - but they'd arrived by car late and left early.</p>
				
				<p>A lady came over to talk to me from an RV. She was Pat from Louisiana and she was joined by Michael. We had a good chat. They'd just done a 10 day long rafting trip down the Grand Canyon and ther daughter lived in Wyoming. After chatting I finished packing and headed off. </p>

				<p>My GPS route took me on some dubious track that, in places, was too sandy for riding and, in other parts, too bumpy to get any speed on. I got to see my first "Buttes". I'd only ever seen the word written down so had imagined it was pronounced "butts" but it turned out they are "b-you-tes". Not quite as amusing to a childish mind.</p>

				<p>I hit the <em>Country Road</em> and it wasn't much better for the first couple of miles. It was unpaved and suffered from the annoying ruts that (washboarding) that feel like they will shake my bike to pieces. Having been singing since the Sierra Nevadas (initially to ward off bears but now it was a habit), the road name inspired me to burst into some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN86d0CdgHQ">John Denver</a> replacing "West Virginia" with "West Wyoming". Thankfully there was nobody around to hear me.</p>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/000055.shtml">Stevens had specifically mentioned</a> <em>Church Buttes</em> which he'd seen a couple of miles to the south of the railroad. Being on the road, I actually went right by them.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14306148985"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2927/14306148985_c97c52b349_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Church Buttes" /></a><figcaption>Church Buttes</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>My road turned back into the Lincoln Highway and it took me through gas fields with solar powered tanks dotted around the landscape making it look populated although there wasn't a soul to be seen.</p>
				
				<p>At a gas works the road had been sprayed with magnesium chloride and the dampness turned the sand/gravel into the horrible aggregate filled mud I'd had before. A few miles later I had to get off the road to avoid the sprayer. The spraying was to stop dust but was sticking to my bike and was not pleasant.</p>

				<p>I turned up the road to remote Granger, passed the new elementary school, and into the town. Once again a building with several dogs errupted in a barking frenzy at my approach. One little dog wasn't chained or fenced in and it ran right up to me barking wildly. When I bent down to see if it would be petted it ran off with its tail between its legs. </p>
				
				<p>I popped into the Town Hall (although it was more like a glorified porta-cabin) and talked to Vivian. She'd lived in Wyoming for 47 years and knew a little about Granger even though she actually lived in Green River. Granger was the meeting of two railroad lines and two rivers. It has a Pony Express station. I'd arrived in their 100th anniversary since been incorporated as a town. Their old school building was to become a community centre and Vivian's office would soon be moving in there. The current Town Hall would go back to being a house.</p>

				<p>Vivian told me I could camp in the park and that she'd tell the police officer when he called in. Around the corner was the Granger branch library which had a suprising number of books for a town with a population of a little over 100. They also had internet connected computers. I chatted to Felicia, the librarian, whose kids were on the computers. She mentioned there was a man on a horse with a flag riding across the country from Oregon and she was following him on Facebook. It seems the West is Facebook country. I am yet to meet anyone on Twitter.</p>
				
				<p>I found the park at the edge of the town (or hamlet). For dinner I went to the <em>Antelope Crossing Pub</em> run by Jessica. At the bar was the lady from the Post Office (I'd sent a postcard to my oldest friend from the town as it shared his surname) and Vern. Vern was one of the last state trappers and had a Thomas Stevens-style moustache. He was quite wiry and had a twinkly in his eye. He'd been trapping for 40 years and had largely taught himself. He caught all sorts of animals across a big area and lamented that youngsters in training wanted to be told how to do everything and get paid. I don't know. Young people of today with their demands!</p>
				
				<p>I was after food so I ordered a calzone from the bar menu and Vern was so convinced that I'd like it he said he'd pay for it if I didn't. We were joined by Tammy who ordered a long drink that I'm sure had whiskey in it. Vern seemed to be nursing a whiskey too. Stevens had described Granger as having:</p>
				
				<p><blockquote>"plenty of whiskey, but no customers"</blockquote></p>
				
				<p>It looked as though things had improved slightly since Stevens' day. Jessica was originally from California and had moved here when she got married. Between the four of us we had quite a conversation.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119673850"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3826/14119673850_75e0139d5b_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Tammy and Jessica" /></a><figcaption>Tammy and Jessica</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I should mention the calzone. It was huge! Great for a long distance cyclist. I had three-quarters of it and Jessica wrapped the remainder for me. I had a blackberry bear from Boston mostly because of the name - <em>Fat Tire</em>. Tammy said she'd get the lady that locks the toilets in the park to leave them open for me and, an hour or so later when I was in my tent, a car pulled up and the lady unlocked the gents for me. I'd met about 8% of the population now. As she jumped back into her SUV, she enigmatically warned:</p>
				
				<p><blockquote>"Don't let the moose step on you during the night."</blockquote></p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0044.html">Short day to Carter</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-20T18:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-20T18:00:00+PDT">Tuesday 20th May 2014 (18:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I'd lost faith in "tracks" in Wyoming so I decided to have anohter night at the KOA and just cycle to Carter and back. It was about 10 miles away over some hills and it was odd to be on an unloaded bike after all this time.</p>
				
				<p>At Carter dogs started barking at me and I was glad to see they were behind a fence. I turned around and completed a loop back around to Lyman. In the town I saw a sandwich shop and <em>Valley Vision</em>. I'd recently lost a small screw from one arm of my glasses so this was perfect. I entertained the staff of Valley Vision with my trip and they fixed my glasses for me. After a pitta sandwich and peanut butter shake I went to the gas station to pick up some supplies. The lady at the counter said she thought I had a cute accent! That is the first time anyone has ever said that to me.</p>
				
				<p>Back at the KOA I did laundry and rested.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-19T20:58:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-19T20:58:00+PDT">Monday 19th May 2014 (20:58 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I headed back towards town then south under the I-80. I stopped at the Forest Service Ranger Station to ask about the road to Piedmont. Apparently it was clear of snow but was dirt/gravel. </p>
				
				<p>I was a month into my phone service so had to call their automated line for my sim card renewal. <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/468406978557931521">It wanted my zip code</a>. It really wanted a zip code. It eventually realised I didn't have one and put me through to a real person who could cope with non-Americans.</p>

				<p>I headed to Hilliard and stopped at the historic markers. To a little beyond a reservoir the road was paved but it then turned to gravel/dirt. For the next few miles the road passed between occasional buildings. It wound its way around the landscape following some of the old railroad grade - the railroad had later been shortened by 10 miles when they built two tunnels so this section had been abandoned after Stevens' time.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119468040"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3797/14119468040_c9e4d345ff_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Road towards Piedmont" /></a><figcaption>Road towards Piedmont</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At Piedmont - named by two Italian women - I saw some old, broken down, buildings but wasn't sure of their age. There were three charcoal kilns and I had lunch there. Apparently Calamity Jane had lived in Piedmont and Butch Cassidy had left from here to rob a bank.</p>

				<p>The road curved around to meet the I-80 again and I saw the only sheep I'd seen in America. They didn't seem to know what to do with a cyclist. I baaed at them but they may not have recognised my British vowel sounds.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119484550"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3807/14119484550_02bf44eaca_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Sheep crossing" /></a><figcaption>Sheep crossing</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I stayed on frontage road (marked with the Old Lincoln Highway "L") along the side of the freeway up a steep, long hill onto the top of a flat mountain. Most of the hills around here look like they've had the tops sliced off. It seems to be that the tops were originally a flat plain that has slowly eroded away. Up on this particular flat-topped hill was a huge wind farm and my road went between the turbines.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119570457"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5569/14119570457_344375832e_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Wind power" /></a><figcaption>Wind power</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I stopped for a rest (and some more Swedish Fish) at the interstate services. A man asked me if I was from California! All through California people thought I was Australian and now someone thought my accent was from California. People seem really bad at placing accents here.</p>
				
				<p>Leaving the services I failed to find the frontage road marked on Open Street Map - the first time it had failed me. At the next intersection I did find a frontage road but it then headed off in the wrong direction leaving me separated from the freeway by a huge carpark and a five foot tall barbed wire fence. I wasn't going backwards so I scaled the fence with my bike. I wasn't sure what the carpark was doing in the middle of nowhere. I'm sure Wyoming folk have their reasons.</p>
				
				<p>There was a fine road into Fort Bridger where I paid the $4 to visit the old trading post where Stevens had stayed. I had a chat with the young woman on the desk who had done a degree in history and was being an intern for the summer. I bought a "sasparilla" mostly because it was something I'd always heard mentioned in cowboy films so wanted to know what it tasted like. It was a tiny bit like a Dandelion & Burdock. I found a house built in 1884 and asked the lady there if she knew which month it was built in as Stevens may have seen it. She wasn't sure but we then talked about my trip.</p>

				<p>Leaving the museum at closing time I headed up to Lyman, through the town and to the KOA ("Kampground of America") where I booked in. I asked the guy at the desk - Reagan - about my next stop (Carter) but he wasn't from Wyoming so didn't know. Later his boss came over and said there were only a few houses there. </p>
				
				<p>Checking my GPS I saw I'd climbed back up to an altitude of 6548 ft which is 1.5 times that of Ben Nevis. I was going to be higher than the entire British Isles throughout Wyoming.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0042.html">Evanston rest day</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-18T20:45:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-18T20:45:00+PDT">Sunday 18th May 2014 (20:45 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>Being ahead of Stevens I had a rest day in Evanston. It wasn't the best day for it as pretty much everywhere except for the motorway services were closed. I walked along the Bear River Greenway. The river itself was in full flow as seems to be expected for May. I wandered around the old town and admiring the now defunct railroad station. It is such a shame that there aren't really passenger services any more.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14306034065"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14306034065_de87a94b56_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Evanston station hasn't been used for passengers in some time" /></a><figcaption>Evanston station hasn't been used for passengers in some time</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I walked up the hill to <em>Subway</em> for lunch. <em>Subway</em> isn't great but it was open and was becoming my most reliable place on the road to get actual vegetable matter. I bought a pink of milk in the services shop only to discover that a US pint is only 473 ml compared to a British 568 ml. Presumably that applies to pints of beer too - Americans are losing out on almost 100 ml!</p>
				
				<p>On-route back to the RV park I stopped to watch some people surfing the standing waves in the Bear River. I sat in the RV park laundry to do some clothes washing and charge my phone. My phone told me I was now "roaming".</p>
