				<h2 class="title"><a href="0049.html">A weekend in Rawlins</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-26T17:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-26T17:00:00+PDT">Monday 26th May 2014 (17:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>As it is Memorial weekend I decided to stay in Rawlins, and relative civilization, until Tuesday. Rose gave me some cloths to clean my bike with. These ended up so filthy that she let me keep them. She had also found a bike shop in the phone book so I visited it. They were closed. Their sign said they'd be back "at 10". Tomorrow? Next week? Next year?</p>
				
				<p>At the grocery store I found Italian bread, proscuitto, (American) parmesan and lettuce. Everywhere else seemed closed as it was Sunday.</p>
				
				<p>At the campground I perused the bookshelf in the laundry and read "Are we there yet?" by David Levithan. It was a better read than the biography of Nancy Reagan, a book by Glen Beck and a huge array of paperback westerns. I can't say if it was better than "The World Out of Control: book four" as I couldn't take its crazy title font seriously.</p>
				
				<p>On the Monday I cycled to the bike shop but it was still closed so I visited the Wyoming State Penitentiary. There I paid for the guided tour and went around with a group of 8 people. Our tour guide spoke her well repeated tour quickly and seemed weirdly proud of some of the more macabre facts. She reminded me of the character of Amy Farrah-Fowler in the Big Bang Theory. At one point we saw the gallows and the gas chamber which she encouraged us to sit in. Three of our party did and took selfies. I found it all a bit unsettling because had been killed in that chair within my lifetime.</p>

				<p>At night, as always, I could hear the sounds of the I-80 and the railroad.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0048.html">A puncture at the Continental Divide</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-24T19:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-24T19:00:00+PDT">Saturday 24th May 2014 (19:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>After an aborted attempt to use the Post Office (it was closed), I got back on the freeway and headed towards Rawlins. About 10 miles from Rawlins I came off at an exit as has become my habit for safety. At the stop sign I saw something on my tyre (tire if you are American). On closer inspection I saw it was a piece of metal. As I removed it I heard a hiss and realised it was the <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/470255369319903232">first puncture of my trip</a>. Thankfully I was already off the freeway and had a spare inner tube from California so I just swapped it out. My Schwalbe Marathon Plus tyres had been amazing but even they couldn't cope with a couple of inches long bit of snow chain. Whilst I was fixing it I noticed I'd broken another spoke on the rear wheel.</p>
				
				<p>I carried on being more wary of the detritous in the hard shoulder and crossed the Continental Divide again. Again? Was I going the wrong direction? It turns out that the Continental Divide splits into two around this part of Wyoming. Between the two Continental Divides is the Great Divide Basin where the water doesn't drain to either the Pacific or the Atlantic. It just sits here. </p>

				<p>One mile from Rawlins I stopped at the services and and got a meal at <em>Denny's</em>. At Rawlins I found RV World which, according to their website gave 10% discount to cyclists. Sounded good to me.</p>
				
				<p>At the reception I met Rose and her husband. They had just taken over the park three weeks before and she was from Pennsylvania via North Carolina. He was into falconry and, as that had introduced him to lots of British people, he demonstrated his knowledge of British swear words to me. They were really friendly and welcoming. I booked for two nights camping.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-23T22:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-23T22:00:00+PDT">Friday 23rd May 2014 (22:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>Rick, my host, was leaving for work at 7:45 so I was up early to leave with him. I went to Walmart to get some mandarins, camping food, a power adapter for my MP3 player and a high calorie breakfast. I also got some better sunscreen that had UVA/B and wasn't supposed to run into your eyes. After all of that my start from Rock Springs wasn't all that early. I headed through town and eventually hit the interstate when other roads ran out. </p>
				
				<p>A few miles along the I-80 I found a service road that ran parallel so took that for a good number of miles to Point of Rocks where I got lunch at the services/gas station. I found more frontage road to the north of the interstate and followed it until I had to rejoin the I-80 to climb a big hill. At the top was a rest stop at "mile 144". It seems states like to tell you how far across them you are. I was congratulated by a truck driver who'd come past me on the hill and was mightily impressed that I'd got up it. After making use of the facilities (and filling up my water bottles at the water fountain) I saw a big dark cloud in the direction I'd come from. There was a bolt of lightning. I jumped on my bike and decided I needed to high-tail it out of there as it was coming towards me. This was <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140521.html">the sort of storm</a> that rolls around the wilds of Wyoming building up its anger. I have never pedalled so fast. Every time a few spots of rain hit me I pedalled faster to keep ahead of the leading edge of the storm.</p>
				
				<p>I reached Continental Divide - the place where the waters on one side reach the Pacific and on the other the Atlantic - and had a brief stop to catch my breath and a quick snack to keep my energy going. </p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119533858"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5542/14119533858_0263d5bc89_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Continental Divide" /></a><figcaption>Continental Divide</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Over Continental Divide (<a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/469932419496161280">7109 ft!</a>) it was downhill into the Great Basin. I reached speeds of over 30 mph. The storm was still chasing me and I more or less maintained speeds of over 15 mph for the 30 miles to <em>Wamsutter</em>. At the small settlement of Wamsutter I went to the I-80 services and not a moment too soon. As I was getting a sandwich the storm hit. There was rain. There was intense hail. There was lightning and it knocked out the power to the services twice. I was so glad I wasn't out on the road in it.</p>
				
				<p>When I left the services the roads were streaming with water so I wimped out of camping. I'd seen on Google Maps that there were two motels. One had had bad reviews so I went to the other. Despite a "vacancy" sign the owners were away until the 26th so I went to the other. There was a sign outside it saying:</p>
				
				<p><blockquote>"Have you been born again?"</blockquote></p>
				
				<p>Inside was a rather gruff lady who'd been smoking and had an aggressive little dog. The room was $55 and I had to "fill in the form" I was told curtly. Her mood lightened up a little once I'd paid her. The room had seen better days but had a remarkably new flatscreen TV although that stopped working when the power for the town went out.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0046.html">Green River and Rock Springs</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-22T22:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-22T22:00:00+PDT">Thursday 22nd May 2014 (22:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I was up early with a night undisturbed by moose (mooses?). I initially followed the WY30 for a short distance before my GPS indicated a track on the left. There didn't really seem to be one. I hesitated. Then I saw a barbed wire fence and a gate section. Back home I'd have been very wary of going into land as a farmer would be out waving a shotgun. However, I'd been told that most of the land in Wyoming was owned by the state and people were allowed to use the tracks. Feeling brave I went through it. </p>
				
				<p>The next few miles were tough going as it wasn't much of a track and what there was had a covering of sand meaning I had to push. My laden bike will not pedal through sand. Eventually, as I climbed up onto some Buttes, the sand lessened and I was able to pedal. Along the top of the Buttes I skimmed with great views in most directions.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14326358043"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3725/14326358043_8fa45bb902_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Railroad views from the top of the Buttes" /></a><figcaption>Railroad views from the top of the Buttes</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I could see smoke from a chemical plant towards the east and the railroad to the north. The track followed the top of the Buttes towards the railroad below then turned right to follow it. I went over a crossing and along the side of the railroad to the chemical works. Here was a sign saying "private railroad crossing" which was OK by me as I wasn't crossing it. There was a chemical smell in the air so I used my buff to cover my nose and mouth. I dread to think what I was breathing in at this remote site. There were lots of trains - parked and moving - that blocked my view from the chemical works. I felt that was a good thing.</p>
				
				<p>At this point I saw my first passenger train since California. I waved at the passengers peering down at me through their tinted windows. I wonder what they made of seeing a cyclist out here in the middle-of-nowhere. Eventually the track needed to cross the railroad at a "private railroad crossing". As my only other alternative was to swim across the river or go the many miles back to the WY30, I ignored the "private" sign. I suspect it was only to cover them against being sued if I had an accident. Further along I waved at some railroad workers out fixing the lines. They waved back.</p>
				
				<p>I wasn't overly comfortable on this frontage road and was glad when I found an off ramp to <em>Byron Road</em>. I ignored my planned route along the side of the railroad in favour of a paved road after hours of sand and dirt. Stevens was a hardy soul.</p>
				
				<p>Back to and over the I-80 I had a long freewheel downhill sandwiched between the freeway and the railroad towards <em>Green River</em>. As I approached the outskirts of the town I was following the river down into the dramatic canyon it had carved. Eons of geological time was exposed for all to see in the layers of rock. I stopped at a 50s diner and, after filling up on calories, I visited the town museum. They had quite a few exhibits (and school parties) and it was good to see them tackling issues such as the massacre of Chinese workers in 1885. It is shameful how badly treated non-Europeans were in the Wild West and the Chinese emigrants didn't even officially count as population.</p>

				<p>From Green River I spotted the Old Lincoln Highway so aimed for that rather than the I-80. This involved a very steep sandy track uphill which I had to walk. It gave me a closer experience to that of Stevens. Under the I-80 and to the cemetary then a very hilly and poor dirt track to join the equally poor Old Lincoln Highway. Thankfully nobody really uses it as I had to weave all over the road to avoid huge holes. I passed more house-like buildings that weren't habitation but some kind of service buildings for gas pipes or other industry. They give the impression of being in a populated landscape when you aren't.</p>

				<p>A couple of miles from <em>Rock Springs</em> the Old Lincoln Highway turned into a paved road and made a pleasant ride into town. Tonight I was staying with a guy named Rick who met me on his fold up bike. At his apartment he gave me some chicken and a baked potato - the first real potato I'd had in weeks. Rick had several bikes. He said:</p>
				
				<p><blockquote>"The optimum number of bikes is n + 1 where n is how many you have."</blockquote></p>
				
				<p>Rick had cycled across the United States in around 36 days on the southern route which makes my 100 day long northern route seem a bit lazy. However, even his time seemed leisurely compared to the fastest crossing of the US which was only 7 days 22 hours! Rick was an interesting guy with lots of cycling experience and a huge range of books in his library. We had a wide-ranging conversation covering everything from Russian politics to me trying to explain what the Eurovision Song Contest was without sounding delusional.</p>
				
				<p>Total distance so far: 1238 miles.</p>
