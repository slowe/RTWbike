				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-12T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-10-12T23:59+0200">Thursday 12th Oct 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Whilst sitting in the youth hostel reception I was told off by a Dutchman who was sharing my dormitory for not having said much to him. He generalised to me not being interactive. Who cares that I'd had a couple of conversations, in French, with the French people in the dormitory? Who cares that I have had conversations with almost everyone I've met for the past 115 days? Who cares that I may just want a chance to rest after 11300 km of cycling? Not actively having a conversation with him meant I am some kind of recluse.</p>
				
				<p>I set off late because of expecting a shorter ride as I was going to stay with a friend of a friend before Faro. But I hadn't heard back from them in a few days so I suspected they might be busy with other stuff and I'd be imposing.</p>

				<p>Not long after setting off I met another cyclist going the same way as me; we both got a bit lost in the one way system in Odi&aacute;xere. His name was David and he was from Barcelona. He had been cycling EuroVelo 1 along the coast of Portugal. We rode together on the understanding that we could go our separate ways if we felt like it. We went to a Lidl to get food and, comically, bought almost the same things. We sat outside on the ground eating and talking. It is funny how much you find in common with people doing big bike trips. So we rode on together. David passed his 1000 km milestone.</p>

				<p>A combination of not hearing back, worrying about how far I still had to cycle before my flight, and good company meant I took a decision. I decided to ride onwards with my new friend. We covered a good distance considering the late start. We passed beyond Faro. So, hopefully, I should get beyond Huelva tomorrow. That should keep me ahead of my rough schedule based on not having a proper route.</p>
				
				<p>Tonight David and I visited a supermarket and bought lots of food and some beers. Then headed to a campsite (&euro;4.20).</p>

				<p>We gorged on pasta, bread, fruit, chocolate salami, and biscuits. We chatted into the night about bike trips, life, running, people and lots more.</p>
				
				<p>It feels so comfortable talking to other people who've ridden by themselves. It was similar with Siri in Scotland and Sander in Norway. There is so much common experience but, also, I think having chosen to ride a long way alone means you share some similar outlooks. A huge part of these bike trips are the people you meet along the way. There is so much warmth, friendship, generosity, and shared humanity. (From all the people you meet, not just those on bikes)</p>

				<p>David had a good phrase today: on a bike trip you see the in-between.</p>

				<p>I was riding along quite happily when my GPS launched itself out of its holder and into the thorny undergrowth by the side of the road. Five minutes were lost locating it and then trying to fish it out with minimal blood loss from the thorny scratches. A few minutes later a big dog came bounding towards me from a shack. I slowed and got off my bike. That stopped its advance. The owners seemed to be shouting something at me from within the shack. My guess is that it was the classic "it won't hurt you". I never believe that. I cleared the area on foot then sped off.</p>

				<p>I reached Lagos (not the one in Africa) a whole hour before sunset. Such luxury! It was just as well as I got the last bed in the youth hostel. I am sharing my dormitory with a Dutchman and a French couple. My high school French has been in more use than I'd expected outside of France.</p>
				
				<p>For once I went and ate out; I found a little chicken shop. I then wandered the evening streets of Lagos like a regular tourist. It was funny to hear British accents.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017120.html">Escaping Sines</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-10T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-10-10T23:59+0200">Tuesday 10th Oct 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I. Am. So. Tired. Of. Navigating.</p>
				
				<p>I just wanted to curl up by the side of the road and cry today. By midday I had only gone 31 km and some of that was going the wrong way. I had far more to cover this afternoon and this evening. It isn't really my legs that are the problem; it is my head. I'm so tired of everything. I'm at "mile 17" of a marathon. A marathon that has been 114 days long so far.</p>

				<p>Getting to Sines was going to be interesting. I'd been warned by Antonio yestrday.</p>
				
				<p>The road started to look more serious. Then, about 15 kilometres out, it turned into a motorway with a "no pedestrians, bikes etc" sign. Why? There was no need for it. There were virtually no vehicles on it. Perhaps it gets busier in the summer. I found there was an un-signed road next to this empty motorway. I passed a couple of cyclists going in the opposite direction. On the outskirts of Sines there was more dodging motorways. I stopped at the Intermarche to get food for later.</p>

				<p>Now I had to leave Sines. Easier said than done. I followed my GPS. But I was tired and I forgot to do the checking of what roads it had picked. They degraded into a track. Well, it shouldn't be for too long by the looks of it. The rough tracks were supposed to take me out of Sines but it turned out someone had blocked my road with another stupid motorway. There was much cursing of the people who did that. Why is Sines motorway obsessed? A man in a clapped out car stopped on the washboard track and told me to follow him to the roundabout. He sped off. I reached the roundabout. I couldn't go on the needless 1.5 km of motorway class road. On the other side I found a washboard track that wasn't on any of my maps. I followed it. It took me back to the point I'd got to 20 minutes ago but on the south side. The motorway had clearly sliced this road in two. Now I could escape though. So long Sines. I won't be back.</p>

				<p>I reached the youth hostel as the sun set. Again. It was more expensive than I would have liked but it saved putting a tent up in the dark. There were also some nice people staying there including Jana from Australia who hasn't really experienced winyer since 2014. She works the Australian summer then has the European summer to explore. I think that is great.</p>
