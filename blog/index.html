				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-05T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-10-05T23:59+0200">Thursday 05th Oct 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Dawn is now earlier on clock time so I was able to see what I was doing as I had breakfast. It was still misty outside though and I couldn't leave until the campsite lady opened the gate for me at 9am. As I waited I heard gunshots from beyond the walls of the campsite. The mist and gunshots combined with the deserted, high-walled, compound with barbed wire added to the feeling I was in a post apocalyptic, zombie-infested, world.</p>
				
				<p>On leaving I was wished "bon voyage" in French and I ventured onto the cobbled roads. I suspect someone high up in the Portugeuse government owns shares in a cobblestone company. So many of the roads are cobbled. It looks nice but vibrates my entire body and bike.</p>
				
				<p>On the main road I noticed there were a lot of cyclists out riding.</p>

				<p>My route took me more away from the coast than I'd have liked but the closer road to the coast was the motorway (or probably cobbled paths).</p>
				
				<p>I arrived in Porto around lunchtime. I dodged the people asking tourists for money and met two Dutch people who are sailing from the Netherlands to New Zealand. They have Bromptons with them for exploring the land.</p>

				<p>I cycled 28 kph flat out for an hour from Ovar to make a ferry that it turned out wouldn't take bicycles. There was a local older lady with a bicycle who was clearly even more annoyed than me about that. We had to wait an hour and a half for the next car ferry. My main concern was that it would mean I was cycling in the dark on the other side as the sun would be setting.</p>

				<p>Thanks to an old colleague from Manchester, Val&eacute;rio, for hosting me in Aveiro at short notice. We went to a fish restaurant and had some local cod-based dish which was very tasty. It was almost a whole day's budget but I should sample "the local seafood dishes that the Atlantic coast has to offer" at least once.</p>

				<p>They had a film crew with them too. As a result I have now been filmed for Brazilian TV.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-03T21:03+0200" datetime="2017-10-03T21:03+0200">Tuesday 03rd Oct 2017 (19:03 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It turns out it was a good job I had decided to wait to book my flight back. It seems the airline I was going to use has just gone bankrupt. Good job I randomly decided to check the BBC news this morning to find out what is happening over in Catalonia.</p>
				
				<p>I was up before dawn (which is getting later) but took a long time to get ready so didn't start early.</p>
				
				<p>I found a supermarket and bought some food. As I returned to my bike I saw a man contemplating it with awe. He asked if I was cycling Europe or the world. I showed him a map of my route on my phone. He shhok his head in disbelief then left.</p>
				
				<p>I had lots of inlets to circumnavigate today. It reminded me of the fjords. If only there were ferries to short cut them.</p>

				<p>I stopped in a little square for lunch. As I made a ham sandwich a huge wasp decided to join me. It wouldn't leave despite my attempts to shoo it. Finally I resorted to spraying it with Smidge that I still had from Scotland. It didn't like Smidge and left me in peace.</p>

				<p>After 147 km I arrived in Cangas to find the hostel I'd been aiming for was shut even if the website said it was open. As far as I could tell, the nearby campsites aren't open on Tuesdays in October either. The Youth Hostel across the water in Vigo had no availability either. Apparently there is some seafood festival happening in Vigo today so the whole bay is packed with tourists.</p>
				
				<p>The first hotel I tried had put their prices up because of all the visitors. They sent me to try another, cheaper, hotel. The second had a bike friendly sign but we're full. However the nice lady in the reception rang around a couple of people she knows. The end result was that I'm paying &euro;20 to stay in a lady's apartment which she isn't in tonight for some reason I couldn't comprehend. On the plus side, I finally have access to a kitchen. Dinner consisted of rice, olives, tuna, and biscuits.</p>
				
				<p>I've had enough of 50km trips around inlets. There should be ferries over the next two.</p>
				
				<p>Tomorrow I should arrive in Portugal.</p>
