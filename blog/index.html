				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-24T23:59+0100" datetime="2017-07-24T23:59+0100">Monday 24th Jul 2017 (22:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I made the most of having a hotel room by sleeping in and having a cooked breakfast. The ferry to John O Groats wasn't until the evening so I pottered about in Kirkwall buying dry bags for my clothes and having some tea in The Reel cafe before visiting St Magnus' cathedral. Then I rode south over the Churchill Barriers to the bottom of South Ronaldsay. Just a few hundred metres from the ferry terminal I could see there wasn't much there so followed a sign to a bistro where I was welcomed by Leona (from Lancashire). Leona was in training for an ultra marathon later in the year. I had a rather small (for a hungry cyclist) portion of rhubarb crumble with custard. After that I went back to the ferry terminal. </p>
				
				<p>Whilst making myself some sandwiches I was joined by Dave, from Coventry, who had spent the past few weeks cycling around the islands. We were joined by a touring cyclist from Lancaster, called Tony, and a Scottish family on bikes. By the time the ferry arrived there were even more bikes there. We had to lug our bikes up to the top deck because the tide was out at the other side and that is the level we'd be disembarking at. During the trip I chatted to Hanz and Maria from Austria. Amongst the usual conversation topics we also talked about Asterix and Obelix and the specific jokes in different languages.</p>
				
				<p>At John O Groats I disembarked and immediately was at the famous fingerpost. There I got talking to Jack and  who kindly took my picture for me.</p>
				
				<p>I opted to stay at the campsite where I met Dave and Tony again. After dinner, the three of us headed to the local pub to exchange stories of our trips. They were both really interesting with entirely different approaches to what they liked to do on their trips but both united in their appreciation of down jackets. It was a good evening. I was finally in Scotland.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-23T23:59+0100 " datetime="2017-07-23T23:59+0100 ">Sunday 23rd Jul 2017 (22:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>With a hotel breakfast in me, and sun in the sky, I decided to delay my full rest day and cycle around Orkney. Compared to Norway it was pretty flat although there was some wind from the north east.</p>
				
				<p>I cycled anticlockwise around the island, visiting a few neolithic sites. At Cuween Hill there was a 3000 year old burial chamber you could crawl into. There were some torches in a box outside but their batteries were low. I was glad to have my bike light with me.</p>
				
				<p>I had to battle the wind to get to the north east of the mainland but then things got easier with the wind partly behind me.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped at Birsay for a late lunch and then was too late to get into Skara Brae. A detour to Stromness to find a fish and chip shop turned up nothing. On the way back to Kirkwall I visited the stones of Stenness. You can hardly move in Orkney without tripping over a 3000, 4000, or 5000 year old structure. Fascinatingly, gaelic had never made it to Orkney. There had been the Picts and Norwegians so Orkadians see themselves as separate to Scotland. </p>
				
				<p>I cycled into Kirkwall by 8pm and went back to the fish and chip shop from last night.</p>

				<p>I took the flight to Kirkwall. As it was operated by Logan Air,  I got a complementary Tunnocks caramel wafer. As we approached Kirkwall, the clouds cleared and we got some great views of the islands. On the ground we had to wait for the border check and then I tried to put my bike back together. The right hand pedal wouldn't go back on. Presumably the problem with it back in Alta meant the thread was messed up. With one pedal I hobbled to Kirkwall in the sunshine.</p>
				
				<p>I found the local bike shop; Cycle Orkney. There, Eric sorted my gears and I got new brake pads as Norway had worn through three sets. Unfortunately he didn't have a front wheel of the right size (I've has a crack in it for a long time now) so suggested a bike shop in Caithness. It would do for now.</p>
				
				<p>My sister had booked me a hotel for two nights so, with a serviced bike, I had the luxury of a bed and shower. Having craved affordable fish and chips for the past thousand kilometres, I went to the local fish and chip shop. I also visited the Coop where I had to be careful not to buy everything.</p>
				
				<p>The weather forecast for tomorrow was OK but getting worse on Monday. I should probably make the most of it.</p>
