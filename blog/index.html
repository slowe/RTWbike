				<h2 class="title"><a href="0028.html">The Maiden's Grave</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-06T12:35:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-06T12:35:00+PDT">Tuesday 06th May 2014 (12:35 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>A mile or two from Beowawe I spotted a large white cross up on a hill marking a grave. I was expecting this because <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/000027.shtml">Thomas Stevens had mentioned it</a>. It was erected by the men who built the railroad to mark the grave of Lucinda Parker Duncan. Stevens described her as a young emigrant woman who had sickened and died at this spot. The present day information board had a different tale to tell. It said she was a 71 year old grandmother who was travelling with her family from Missouri in 1863. She was considered "mother of the wagon train" as it consisted mostly of her seven children as well as their wives, husbands, grandchildren and other relatives. When she died, her family held a funeral for her and put her in what she thought was her last resting place. However, after Stevens, in 1906 it was reportedly moved a short distance to its current spot. Around Lucinda's cross, there are now quite a few more graves that have been added in the years since.</p>

				<p>It <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/463704546393337858">had rained overnight</a> and was still overcast. I hoped the rain would have compacted the sandy bits of track to stop my rear wheel sinking and messing up my steering.</p>
				
				<p>I left Battle Mountain on the frontage road despite the warnings from the truckers I'd met a couple of days ago. It was actually very quiet.</p>

				<p>I arrived at Dunphy to find a small RV park. There was a lady with a little Yorkshire terrier who I stopped to chat to. I told her I was from Yorkshire (whilst wearing my Tour de Yorkshire top). She told me it was her daughter, Shayne's RV park and that she was in the minimart if I needed anything. This really was a minimart. It was basically the size of a large garden shed. It had a single fridge and a very limited selection of chocolate. On the counter were two bananas. I asked Shayne if they were for sale. It turned out they were her lunch but upon hearing I was on a bicycle she kindly sold me one of them along with a drink and some chocolate. At that point we were interrupted by some genuine cowboys who came in to buy supplies. They had very cool cowboy hats. After they left I got chatting with Shayne and she decided to message her friend from the local mine to ask for advice for me about the route to Beowawe. I hung around for a few minutes chatting with her and her friend said it should be fine.</p>

				<p>With good wishes from Shayne and the OK from her local friend, I set off towards Beowawe. The road took me under the freeway and then the landscape seemed to change. Compared to the past few days it was <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/463765513827385346">vageuly reminiscent</a> of the Lake District although the wildlife clearly wasn't.</p>

				<p>Beowawe itself was a small collection of ramshackle buildings. There wasn't much sign of life but I suspected eyes may be watching me and I moved on. My original route plan had me going back up to the freeway but it looked as though there was a road that followed the railroad and Google Maps suggested there were tracks. I still hadn't learned my lesson.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0026.html">A rest day</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-05T18:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-05T18:00:00+PDT">Monday 05th May 2014 (18:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I had started to get a head cold during the night. As I'm ahead of Stevens, I decided to have a rest day. I spent it mostly in bed with medication, tea and bits of American TV. I felt very lazy.</p>
				
				<p>I was aware of Battle Mountain before I arrived. Being on a large, flat, plain, it is the location of the human-powered land speed record. In 2009 Canadian Sam Whittingham had come here and set the record at an incredible 82.8 mph. A few months before my trip, Sebastiaan Bowier from the Netherlands had been here and managed to get to 83.13 mph. I bet they didn't have panniers on their bikes.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-04T20:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-04T20:00:00+PDT">Sunday 04th May 2014 (20:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>My Winnemucca hosts provided me with a hearty breakfast of bacon, eggs, and freshly picked spinach from the garden. Henry and his family had been excellent hosts and made me feel extremely welcome in their home. They were a great introduction to WarmShowers.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14009628069"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5517/14009628069_dc15e09d9e_c.jpg" alt="photo" title="Henry of Winnemucca" /></a><figcaption>Henry of Winnemucca</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>After breakfast, Henry accompanied me on the start of the frontage roads to ensure I kept close to the railroad and therefore as close to Stevens' route as I could. In fact I was as close as I could be to the railroad without being on it. Every so often an endlessly long freight train would slowly pass by blasting its horn. I'd wave at the drivers and a few would wave back. I wondered if any of the drivers did the same route and would start to recognise me over the weeks.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14196298415"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7399/14196298415_d0b00b19a4_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Next to the railroad" /></a><figcaption>Next to the railroad</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Around the edge of a mountain range, the route took a swing to the south-east and, after ending up in some kind of rest area, the frontage road seemed to die out so I back-tracked and joined the freeway. I followed it to the next exit at Golconda and could see the interstate rising to cross a range a few miles ahead. Instead, given there seemed to be an alternative, I joined the Old Highway 40 and then took the intriguingly named <em>Midas Road</em>. This seemed to be a road for access to mines and, given the name, it suggested gold even though Nevada's motto was "The Silver State". Just before Midas Road crossed the Humboldt River I took a dirt track off to the right that followed the river and railroad around the range that the freeway had been going over. I was now out of sight of the freeway and paved roads. This felt more remote than anywhere I'd been so far as I'd previously had a freeway or state road in view even if they weren't close.</p>

				<p>Around the edge of the range the view widened out and the road got worse. It would be generous to describe it as a farm track. The landscape was hot and the sand was dry and cracked. Despite the dryness, the desert was filled with sage brush. Occasionally there would be a shock of red due to some kind of hardy flower. In contrast to the desert, the mountains to the south were topped in snow.</p>

				<p>A gravel road appeared that took a turn away from the railroad and towards the freeway miles away in the distance. With it looking more substantial, I took it. It gave me my first experience of "washboarding"; ripples in the road caused by the treads of big vehicles. Despite their looks, the ripples were solid and their spacing meant my bike and its occupant were shaken so violently that I worried my bike might fall to pieces.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14193019971"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7341/14193019971_8c5e77d1a8_c.jpg" alt="photo" title="Washboarding" /></a><figcaption>Washboarding</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Reaching the interstate I checked Google Maps which claimed there was a frontage road. I followed this deteriorating road for three and a half miles before it disappeared and hit a fence. I stopped. On the other side of the fence I saw an antelope or deer. It saw me and looked at me with what I imagine was a confused and nervous expression. It didn't know what to make of me. It may not have seen a person on a bicycle and certainly wasn't expecting one out here. I told it not to worry as it was on the other side of the fence. I turned around an cycled the three and a half miles back to the freeway exit I'd been at earlier, then cycled back along the freeway. A totally pointless extra seven miles.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped at the next services for food to get my energy up. I was the only customer so, after serving me, the lady in the gas station shop left her post to feed the row of one-armed bandits. Nevada likes to give you opportunities to gamble even whilst at work.</p>
				
				<p>I headed on to the brilliantly named <em>Battle Mountain</em> where I found a motel to stay the night. Outside the rooms I got talking to a friendly couple of truckers who said they'd passed me earlier and were wondering where I was headed. One of the truckers, Rex, told me not to worry about the Rockies as I was already "half way up them" and that once I got over them it was "downhill all the way to Boston". I'm sure it feels that way if you are in a truck! I told them how impressed I'd been with the truck drivers through the mountains and desert. Rex was so taken by my trip that he gave me his email address and insisted that I send him updates as I made my way across the country.</p>
				
				<p>The motel room had a large bath unlike all the shallow ones I've experienced in California. I made good use of it and washed my clothes in it after I'd washed myself.</p>
