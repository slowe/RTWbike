				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-06T16:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-06T16:00:00+PDT">Tuesday 06th May 2014 (16:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>As I left the graveyard it started spitting and I put on my waterproofs. </p>

				<p>The road wasn't paved but it was good for a couple of miles. Then it left the company of the railroad and started to climb. It also started to deteriorate. I passed some small caves and convinced myself that they were the dens of mountain lions. I'd been told that mountain lions tended to hunt at dusk and dawn because their eyes were adapted for the lower light levels. I'd also heard that running away from them would trigger their chase mode. Even if there were cougars I was now in no danger of triggering a chase mode because I was now going uphill with my heavy bike and the surface had turned into the worst possible. </p>
				
				<p>The track became a mixture of mud, sand and pebbles that stuck solidly to my tyres and then the frame. My speed was limited to under one mile an hour. Seriously. I had to keep stopping every few metres to claw out the mud to let my wheels turn. Part way up the hill I had to take my panniers off, walk them up the hill a bit and then go back and try to push my bike up. My feet started to get covered in the same mud. It was like walking through molasses. It was sapping the energy from me. I tried pushing my bike over the woody sage brush but that had a tendency to grab hold of the frame and get me stuck. It was probably only about 3pm but I realised I had a minimum of three miles to go to any form of civilization. That was if the tracks that had been on Google Maps even existed. I was now well out of cell phone signal. It would get dark before I'd get anywhere and I didn't want to be exposed at cougar hunting time.</p>
				
				<p>I thought of the railroad. I'd left it a while back and it was somewhere to the north. I struck out away from the nightmare track over the sage brush to find it. I then realised that I'd ascended about 800ft and was at the top of a hill with the railroad in the valley below along with the Humboldt River. The railroad was the closest thing I was going to get to feeling safe.</p>

				<p>If this had been the Lake District or North Wales there would have been a sheep track or footpath to follow down into the valley. Out here few creatures roamed so there were no clues to a safe way down. The way I picked was down a gulley. It wasn't great but then I'm not sure any other route would have been better. At one point near the top I had to down-climb a bit of vertical rock. In fact I had to do that three times as I had to do one trip with my bike and two more with pannier bags and the Ikea bag. Even once off the vertical part it was still too steep to have the bags on the bicycle and and had to keep doing 50 metre sections taking one thing at a time. Half way down I was knackered and decided the priority was to get camped. So, apologetically, I left my bike behind and continued down with the bags. I promised it I'd be back in the morning <em>if</em> I survived the night.</p>

				<p>At the bottom I realised that the Humboldt river was between me and the railroad. Glad of my waterproof Ortleib panniers I forded the river. I was soaked up to my chest. Up the bank on the other side I found a six foot barbed wire fence between me and the raised railroad. I decided my best bet was pitching my tent between the two so that the railroad and the fence afforded me some protection from wild animals. After all, it wasn't just cougars out there. There could be bears too. Up and over the fence I went. I pitched my tent. I then covered it in pulled up dead branches of sage brush. This was partially to hide it and partially to provide a bit more of a barrier than a thin tent wall. I cooked up some dehydrated packet food which tasted wonderful given what I'd been through. I changed out of the wet clothes into my spare merino top and my thermal trousers and bedded down for the night. I took out my camp knife and the can of mace to be ready.</p>
				
				<p>It was probably only about 5pm but I wasn't going to be 'outside' as dusk fell so I got in my sleeping bag and closed my tent. I made sure to write in my journal about what had happened. I also added a "next of kin" address into the front of it in case I was eaten during the night. I tried to get some sleep.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0028.html">The Maiden's Grave</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-06T12:35:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-06T12:35:00+PDT">Tuesday 06th May 2014 (12:35 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>A mile or two from Beowawe I spotted a large white cross up on a hill marking a grave. I was expecting this because <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/000027.shtml">Thomas Stevens had mentioned it</a>. It was erected by the men who built the railroad to mark the grave of Lucinda Parker Duncan. Stevens described her as a young emigrant woman who had sickened and died at this spot. The present day information board had a different tale to tell. It said she was a 71 year old grandmother who was travelling with her family from Missouri in 1863. She was considered "mother of the wagon train" as it consisted mostly of her seven children as well as their wives, husbands, grandchildren and other relatives. When she died, her family held a funeral for her and put her in what she thought was her last resting place. However, after Stevens, in 1906 it was reportedly moved a short distance to its current spot. Around Lucinda's cross, there are now quite a few more graves that have been added in the years since.</p>

				<p>It <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/463704546393337858">had rained overnight</a> and was still overcast. I hoped the rain would have compacted the sandy bits of track to stop my rear wheel sinking and messing up my steering.</p>
				
				<p>I left Battle Mountain on the frontage road despite the warnings from the truckers I'd met a couple of days ago. It was actually very quiet.</p>

				<p>I arrived at Dunphy to find a small RV park. There was a lady with a little Yorkshire terrier who I stopped to chat to. I told her I was from Yorkshire (whilst wearing my Tour de Yorkshire top). She told me it was her daughter, Shayne's RV park and that she was in the minimart if I needed anything. This really was a minimart. It was basically the size of a large garden shed. It had a single fridge and a very limited selection of chocolate. On the counter were two bananas. I asked Shayne if they were for sale. It turned out they were her lunch but upon hearing I was on a bicycle she kindly sold me one of them along with a drink and some chocolate. At that point we were interrupted by some genuine cowboys who came in to buy supplies. They had very cool cowboy hats. After they left I got chatting with Shayne and she decided to message her friend from the local mine to ask for advice for me about the route to Beowawe. I hung around for a few minutes chatting with her and her friend said it should be fine.</p>

She took a picture of me to add to Facebook." /></a><figcaption>Shayne at Dunphy minimart. She took a picture of me to add to Facebook.</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>With good wishes from Shayne and the OK from her local friend, I set off towards Beowawe. The road took me under the freeway and then the landscape seemed to change. Compared to the past few days it was <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/463765513827385346">vageuly reminiscent</a> of the Lake District although the wildlife clearly wasn't.</p>

				<p>Beowawe itself was a small collection of ramshackle buildings. There wasn't much sign of life but I suspected eyes may be watching me and I moved on. My original route plan had me going back up to the freeway but it looked as though there was a road that followed the railroad and Google Maps suggested there were tracks. I still hadn't learned my lesson.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0026.html">A rest day</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-05T18:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-05T18:00:00+PDT">Monday 05th May 2014 (18:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I had started to get a head cold during the night. As I'm ahead of Stevens, I decided to have a rest day. I spent it mostly in bed with medication, tea and bits of American TV. I felt very lazy.</p>
				
				<p>I was aware of Battle Mountain before I arrived. Being on a large, flat, plain, it is the location of the human-powered land speed record. In 2009 Canadian Sam Whittingham had come here and set the record at an incredible 82.8 mph. A few months before my trip, Sebastiaan Bowier from the Netherlands had been here and managed to get to 83.13 mph. I bet they didn't have panniers on their bikes.</p>
