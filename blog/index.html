				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015033.html">To Budapest</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-06T23:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-06T23:00:00+0200">Saturday 06th Jun 2015 (21:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I awoke to the sounds of footsteps on the pebble beach outside my tent. It was 5.15 am. Who was it? Was a knife going to slice through the thin, green, material into me? Was it a wild animal? I tried to think more clearly and decided it best to poke my head out of the flap. I looked around. A man was setting up a chair and his fishing kit. He didn't say anything and just continued setting up. I realised I'd probably taken his usual fishing spot and the beach wasn't really big enough for the two of us. I packed up my things and loaded up my bike. I'd been wanting to have a morning swim but I decided that I shouldn't as it would scare the fish away.</p>
				
				<p>With the Sun rising, I pushed out of my camp at 5.45 am for <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/607227224270487553">the earliest start I've had on the trip</a>. Back up on the path I found the fisherman's Lada and then lost the path. It just sort of stopped next to some more fishermen. I tried going along a hint of a path but that became a dead end. This certainly wasn't the EV6. After a bit of back-tracking I found where it had gone and was back on the right road. I arrived at Neszm&eacute;ly - Thomas Stevens' stop the night before - at 6.30 am to find that the first shop was open and already had a customer. I stocked up on food and drink. As I went through the village I found more little shops and then a SPAR. It was hardly 7 am and it was packed. People definitely got an early start to their day in Hungary. Amongst the other things on offer in SPAR I found Monty Python and Sherlock DVDs. I stocked up some more.</p>
				
				<p>After Nyerges&uacute;jfalu, I stopped on the side of a bike path to gorge on breakfast made of all the food I'd bought at three shops. I must have been a weird site to the people of all ages that cycled past me.</p>
				
				<p>By lunchtime, following the curves of the Danube, I reached Esztergom - the catholic capital of Hungary. Up on the hill, with tremendous views across into Slovakia and along the Danube in both directions, stood a huge cathedral. In the little ticket office I had the option to buy tickets to various parts. Following Strasbourg and Ulm, I opted for a trip up to the top of the dome. The ticket seller warned me that it was a long way up. I said I should probably be able to manage. At the top the <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/607228413519216640">views were stunning</a>. </p>

				<p>After the visit to the cathedral I dropped back down to the river and the EV6. After Esztergom the river bends back around to the east to head between some hills. Here there are some beaches and the locals were making the most of them. I found one unoccupied so occupied it and had my lunch. As I finished up, I was passed by a touring tandem and a minute or so later by a couple of other touring cyclists. I followed them the next few miles up to a point that I had thought was a bridge to Szob but turned out to be a ferry. As we waited for the ferry I got talking to them. The tandem was named "Big Purple" and was ridden by Heather and Richard who were from north Wales. Also waiting for the ferry were <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/607230198812176384">a couple of German cyclists</a> and Richard and Andre from Strasbourg. I rode with Heather and Richard for a bit but parted ways as they went off to find a late lunch. On the ferry they had said that we were heading to Slovakia. I worried that I had no Euros but that was premature as it turned out the border had moved north just before Szob and we were still in Hungary.</p>

				<p>I carried along following the northern bank of the Danube to V&aacute;c passing canoes floating down the river and plenty of other cyclists on the bike route. Hungary is proving itself to be a bike-riding nation. On the other side of the river there was a castle or big house up on a hill with a grand prospect.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19427015536"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/510/19427015536_a755df478a_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Canoe" /></a><figcaption>Canoe</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>At V&aacute;c I had a while to wait for the ferry and joined Richard and Andre - the French cyclists - for a drink at a nearby cafe. When the ferry arrived we parted ways only to find ourselves meeting up again a few miles down the road. We cycled together for a few miles to Szentendre before parting ways again. </p>

				<p>I then headed along a bike route of various quality - sometimes great and sometimes awful - into Budapest. Coming into Budapest I met my first aggressively beeping driver of the trip. He wanted me to be in the cycle lane. So did I but the big fence between me and it meant I couldn't. As was becoming familiar on this trip, road and building works had removed cycle paths in places or re-routed them in ways that were difficult to follow for a visitor. Still, I got into Budapest and found free wifi at a Shell petrol station. Someone had told me that petrol stations were a reliable place to get wifi in this part of Europe. </p>
				
				<p>Online I found a youth hostel on the other side of the river so headed across. Although it was upstairs on the first floor, Adam the guy on duty was very friendly and helpful so let me bring my bike upstairs. It was the first hostel since the UK that had a kitchen I could actually make use of so I cooked dinner and made a cup of tea. It was a good, international, hostel with guests from Hungary, Mexico, Thailand, the Phillipines and Scotland. The Scottish guy had arrived back at the hostel but had lost his phone. I spent the rest of the evening helping him cancel his phone, contact people back in the UK and sort out his insurance. He also had to reset a lot of his online passwords.</p>

				<p>In the morning I packed up my tent and headed east out of Mosonmagyar&oacute;v&aacute;r to Hal&aacute;zi then through a series of small villages past long-horned cattle that Stevens had remarked upon and a small Jewish cemetary which had particular significance after my visit to Dachau in Germany.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/18830331844"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/300/18830331844_a4dea1ea94_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Jewish cemetary" /></a><figcaption>Jewish cemetary</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>I reached the lovely Gy&#337;r near lunchtime and, as I crossed the river, spotted an old Mississippi-style paddle steamer.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19265285958"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/19265285958_451bee8f18_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="River at Gy&#337;r" /></a><figcaption>River at Gy&#337;r</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Over into the main square I had a rest and then had a man come up to me, present me with a map of the town and then walk off. I found the tourist information office and obtained both a sticker and a local map showing cycle routes. I then found a McDonalds to use the toilet but found there was a little lady who made you pay. As I left the toilet I saw a lady had a dress fully tucked into her knickers. I tried to quietly say something to her but as I was speaking English she ignored me and walked off into the street unawares.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19457136241"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/268/19457136241_478054568b_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Main square of Gy&#337;r" /></a><figcaption>Main square of Gy&#337;r</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>I decided to follow the "official" bike map as it showed a route to G&ouml;ny&#369; that avoided the motorway. Unfortunately, it took me along the 1 which then preceded to have lots of signs along it saying no bikes! This was the town's advertised cycle route and you can't cycle on it. I started to think that Hungary wasn't very joined up. Having no alternative road other than the motorway, I ignored the signs and pressed on. I had to keep ignoring them until somewhere near &Aacute;cs. </p>
				
				<p>After Kom&aacute;rom the route seemed to go off the 1, closer to the river. This took me along a dyke wall and into a wood where the path turned into a, well, footpath. I spotted a lovely little secluded beach just off the path. I was just under five miles from Neszm&eacute;ly - Stevens' destination for tonight - and I decided, as I didn't know if there would be camping ahead, to camp here for tonight.</p>
				
				<p>I pitched my tent on the pebble beach, had a quick swim in the Danube, cooked some food, and admired the glorius sunset from my little spot. I wasn't entirely alone - I could hear occasional sounds from the far side of the river in Slovakia - but it still felt exciting. I was also without internet as my sim card decided it wouldn't let me have roaming in Hungary. In the evening I heard two teenage lads making their way down to my little beach from the path but when they saw my tent they went somewhere else. As the stars came out I watched the lights of the river cruise boats making their way up and down the river. It was as close to perfect as I could get.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015031.html">Three countries in a day</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-04T21:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-04T21:00:00+0200">Thursday 04th Jun 2015 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Last night I finally had an interactive room mate in the dorm. He was Donny, from Wisconsin, and was touring Europe. He seemed a bit fed up that the girls staying at the hostel were all in school groups and too young for him.</p>
				
				<p>I left the hostel at 8.30 am and it was suspiciously quiet. There was virtually no traffic on the streets. It was only when I found that the supermarket was closed that I realised that Stevens had warned me about this; it was Corpus Christi. I'd been banking on getting supplies for the day at the supermarket so now I had nowhere to get food or drink from. Eventually, on the way out of Vienna, I tracked down a water fountain and filled up my bottles.</p>
				
				<p>Unfortunately the EV6 mostly takes the north bank of the river at this point but I had to go to Schwechat to follow Stevens. The roads weren't too bad - probably helped by the fact it was a holiday. That is the second capital city I've been lucky enough to be cycling in on a holiday. </p>
				
				<p>When travelling through so many countries it is interesting to see how things change. One little change I noticed was the style of the people on the pedestrian/bicycle signs. They had been consistently blue through Europe but the little silhouettes varied. In Austria the adult had gained a little hat and the child a dress.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/18555648590"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/345/18555648590_b164a3bbc2_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Pedestrian sign" /></a><figcaption>Pedestrian sign</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>My "radroute" took me <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606379599061237760">through the airport</a> making it the fifth international airport that I've cycled to, from or through; the others being Heathrow (to), San Francisco (from), Boston (to), and Gatwick (through). I was then passing on a mixture of roads and cycle lanes (EV6 again) through farmland and by wind farms.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19452707715"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/19452707715_63bbbb2616_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Farms - land and wind" /></a><figcaption>Farms - land and wind</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>After passing one particularly large wind farm I found the Heidentor - an ancient Roman gate - just before Petronelle-Carnuntum. Nobody was quite sure why it had been built but part of it remains. It also had signs in the ground pointing to various important cities in the Roman world. I was happy to find my first sign to Constantinopolis (Istanbul). Onwards!</p>

				<p>I rode through quiet little villages filling my bottle up at water fountains. As the path got closer to the Danube I started to be joined by a few families out for a ride on the holiday. At Hainburg I found the 900 year old archway that Stevens described. There were no rows of Hungarian soliders lining the streets this Corpus Christie though. That tradition seems to be long gone. At the other side of Hainburg old town I found another archway. That left me wondering if I'd be admiring the wrong one before. I took a picture with this one too just to be safe.</p>

				<p>Up a slight rise gave a view across a plain to the unmistakable sight of Bratislava in the distance. Bratislava is in Slovakia and I knew I'd have to cross a border. I didn't know what currency was used either. As it turns out the old border post is deserted and the bike path just carries on into Slovakia and under the motorway bridge that crosses the Danube. There were now lots of people out on bikes enjoying the sunshine.</p>

				<p>Across the river I noted that the pedestrian on the pedestrian sign had obtained a more jaunty hat and the child a bow in their hair. I stopped for lunch and cake and was glad to find they took Euros. After that I went up the hill to the castle for a brief visit. I didn't go inside as I was trying to make my budget stretch and I even avoided the toilets when I found they were 1 Euro.</p>

				<p>Back across the Danube underneath another road bridge took me back to the EV6 which was slightly re-routed along a footpath at one point due to building work. It is suprising how badly re-routed it can be considering it is a major international cycle route. I wonder if the people who do the re-routing know that. Perhaps they don't care. Aside from this, the cycle track (shared with pedestrians) was excellent and ran for miles. It made for very pleasant riding. </p>
				
				<p>My GPS was having trouble routing me on this bit mostly because I was near a national border and the way I've compiled OpenStreetMap seems to have trouble at borders. That didn't matter though because the way was obvious. I crossed the border into Hungary but only knew that because of my map.</p>
				
				<p>The first village I encountered - Rajka - had tourist signs in multiple languages. <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606505327811555330">It turns out</a> that in Roman times they had "limes protecting the empire"; I love a comedy mistranslation.</p>
				
				<p>With a separate bike lane I was bowling along at a good pace but also able to admire the countryside. The thing that struck me was how colourful the fields were. Reds, blues, <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606774340319903744">purples</a>, greens and yellows.</p>

				<p>Just before 5 o'clock I reached the little village of Bezenye and took a picture of the church as the bells rang out. A little old lady who lived opposite the church saw me, smiled and waved. I smiled back and tried to say something to her but either she was hard of hearing or didn't understand English so just sort of nodded at me smiling. I waved and carried on. </p>

				<p>At Mosonmagyar&oacute;v&aacute;r my first task was to get some money. I found an ATM but then panicked when the withdrawal screen offered me amounts like 10,000 florins. I didn't know the exchange rate. Would I be emptying my bank account? A quick text to my niece in London brought me the answer. There were around 400 florins in a British pound. Having got my money I then spotted a sign for camping and found a pitch at the Thermal Hotel Aqua. The campsite area was mostly motorhomes and, like the RVs of America, their occupants didn't seem interested in talking to cyclists with tents.</p>
				
				<p>When I checked in the lady at the desk didn't really have enough English but seemed to tell me I had to come back for the spa at 8pm. I assumed they must have some kind of allotted times and mine was later as I'd arrived late in the day. At 7.55 pm I duly turned up only to discover that it closed at 8 pm. She'd been trying to tell me that but had only managed to communicate the importance of 8 pm. Seeing that I'd lost out, a man who'd been sitting out at the front looking through paperwork came over to help me. He was some kind of cross between a manager, a bouncer and a janitor. Whatever his role, he seemed kind and beckoned for me to follow him. It turned out I could use the small swimming pool/spa until 10 pm so I was able to relax in their thermal waters after all. It meant I got a bath and a shower!</p>
				
				<p>I learned that the Hungarian for thank you sounds like "ger-ser-nam".</p>

				<p>The youth hostel I was staying at was on the large 'island' created by a split in the Danube. It was actually a few miles from most of the main tourist sites and seemed largely to be be visited by large school groups. As I sat on the floor in the reception area - the only place the wifi was available - an angry looking man came through the door. He gave me an evil looking stare as he went by. The hostel was huge so I reasoned that the chances of him being in the same room as me were small. A little later when I got back to the room I was pleased to find it empty. However, a few minutes later, he turned up. He was my room mate and he'd had a bit to drink. It turned out he'd missed his last train or bus home from Vienna. Thankfully he wasn't a beligerant drunk but he still made me nervous. I kept my important possessions (money, passport, phone) very close throughout the night. In the morning he left and I stayed in bed for a while.</p>

				<p>I was in a major capital city full of sights but I really needed to do some laundry. The hostel, despite its size, didn't have any laundry facilities. They told me of a laundrette two miles away. Thankfully I had a bike so that wasn't a worry for me. <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/605364839469461505">I did my washing</a>. It is nice to have fresh smelling clothes. I also visited the supermarket. I was really living it up in Vienna.</p>
				
				<p>On Tuesday, I decided to visit the Vienna Wanderers' Bicycle Club as Stevens had done. The problem is that they don't exist any more and neither does the street they were on; Schwimmschulenstrasse. <a href="https://twitter.com/Reesiepie/status/605425446864461825">Marie O'Sullivan on Twitter</a> managed to find out that it was near the station (<a href="http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=116717&imageview=true">grid reference F3 in an old map of Vienna</a>) only Schwimmschulenstrasse between 1873-1919. It was now Lassallestrasse. Even though the bicycle club didn't exist, I visited anyway and rode the length of the street. Afterwards I stumbled across an impromptu solar system scale model in the street near the station that was organised by the Zeiss Planetarium Wien. I then wandered over to the big wheel and had a ride through the large park. I then cycled over to the main part of the city and whiled away the afternoon snoozing in the pleasant Rathausplatz park near the Rathaus (town hall).</p>

				<p>Wednesday was my last full day in Vienna so I went to the MuseumsQuartier to visit _mumok_ - the museum of modern art. It had everything from David Hockney (<a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606073606028853249">pleased to see him labelled as "Bradford, Yorkshire"</a>) to Yoko Ono to videos of naked bodies having paint thrown at them. Outside the MuseumsQuartier was a <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606152094505177089">vegan festival</a> and I had a very nice vegan curry with lassi. As I left the festival I saw a young woman on a zebra-stripe bike adorned with roses. She told me it was some kind of pun as the German words for zebra and bike are similar.</p>
