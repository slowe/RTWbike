				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-17T23:50+0100 " datetime="2017-07-17T23:50+0100 ">Monday 17th Jul 2017 (22:50 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It rained all through the night. I put my tent away in a brief pause but everything was still soaked. I headed to Ulsteinvik to see about a wheel. Biltema didn't have any, G Sport didn't have one. Intersport didn't have any in stock but could order one by Wednesday. I can't afford the delay. Then the Intersport man suggested he could take a wheel off one of their display bikes. It was a disc brake wheel so might not be strong enough for v-brakes but it would get me going. It cost 600 krones but I don't think he charged me for the work.</p>

				<p>With a new, but, uncertain, wheel, I went food shopping. I broke out my UK bank card and spent &pound;36 on food. Much of which was the cheapest you could get. I ate half of it. My mood was really low. I'd overspent dramatically in Norway. It all takes away from my future. I was nearly of the intention of calling it a day once I got to Bergen.</p>
				
				<p>I set out again into the cold rain. I headed over surprise hills in the rain. It was getting colder. My hands, in my neoprene gloves, we're getting seriously wrinkly. I could see my breath. I had to take a ferry but the ticket seller missed me. I like to think it was deliberate to let me off given how miserable it was.</p>
				
				<p>More hills and more fjords in chilling rain. Little roadside streams were raging torrents.</p>

				<p>I eventually gave up in &Aring;him where I saw a sign for camping. The young people running the Jetsund Camping were kind enough to let me use the shower (they provided a free towel to use) and to use the washing machine and dryer for free. I washed all my clothes for the first time. Hooray. Being able to get things dry helped lift my spirits. I chatted to some friendly Norwegians. They cheered me up too.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017034.html">Wind and a wheel </a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-16T22:00+0100 " datetime="2017-07-16T22:00+0100 ">Sunday 16th Jul 2017 (21:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It had rained in the night but was relatively ok as I set off. As I reached the western end of the island and a place called Dryna it started to rain. Not so dry in Dryna. As I took to ferry over to Brattv&aring;g the rain set in. The temperature drops when it rains. It gets closer to the temperature of the ocean. Rather than take the National Cycle Route 1 on a big diversion around the coast, I took the high road up and through a tunnel. Out the other side I had a nice straight road down that I could take full use of. I had the wind behind me. The rain got worse.</p>

				<p>At the end of the fjord I bought food in the only shop open and then sheltered in the door of a Thai food hut. The rain wasn't stopping so I pressed on. Now the wind was against me too.</p>

				<p>As I passed into a different fjord it became broken showers but I still had a bit of wind against me. At Spjelkavika I had a choice. Take the road south to a ferry or into &Aring;lesund where there was a longer ferry. The timetable I got last night suggested they were about the same price. &Aring;lesund it was then. There was a bike/pedestrian path most of the way into town but it kept changing sides and had bad curbs and bumpy stretches. At one point my rear brakes nearly failed. I adjusted them. A bit further along I realised they were juddering. I checked my wheel. It was cracked on the rim. Again?! It was Sunday. Everywhere was closed. Do I go back to Spjelkavika and wait for morning. That would cost time and money. Neither of which I have spare. I pressed on. </p>

				<p>I took the ferry out of &Aring;lesund. Except the ticket seller said this wasn't a ferry and rather than being about 40 krones as suggested by my ferry timetable, this not-a-ferry-ferry was 115 krones. Drat. We had already set off (they set off before you buy your ticket). This day was getting worse.</p>
				
				<p>I disembarked in the rain. I went up a hill hoping the houses would stop so I could wild camp. Near the top of the long hill I found the only flat bit of land away from houses I could. It was basically a bog. There were a million midges. My pegs would hardly stay in. I had to take my wet things inside my tent. I made food inside my tent and hoped the water level of the bog didn't rise. It would be like Nebraska all over again and I had no toilet block to escape to.</p>

				<p>I didn't want to leave my lovely spot but I had to. I have to reach Bergen for the pre-booked flight.</p>
				
				<p>A little way along the coast I was beckoned over by a retired farmer. He had previously taught mechanics. He told me that his family had emigrated from Scotland in the 18th century. He said that the hill behind him was something to do with NATO. Or Netto. I'm not sure.</p>

				<p>I went for a dip in the sea again. It was sunny so I could dry off afterwards.</p>

				<p>I reached Bud in time for lunch and had my customery two fried eggs on a picnic bench. It was just down from a house where a man was diligently cleaning his Porche (his Tesla was sat next to it). He didn't seem put out by my bedraggled presence.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEykefRXoAAS2HO?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Bud" /><figcaption>Bud</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>The next bit of coastline took me deep into a fjord and back so took about 20km to go 2km. It feels very inefficient and like you aren't making progress.</p>
				
				<p>I went past a very triangular mountain.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEylZjQXgAI8FFe?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Mountainy mountain" /><figcaption>Mountainy mountain</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I reached the ferry just before M&oslash;lde and had to wait. In the queue were a couple of young men in Hawaiian shirts, adorned with garlands, and clearly a bot drunk. It is expensive to get drunk in Norway. One of them mooned the window of a band's tour bus that was also in the queue. </p>
				
				<p>The ferry was quick and took my over to an island that I will leave tomorrow. It seemed to consist of steep mountains with a thin strip of land between them and the sea. So, like much of Norway.</p>
				
				<p>Just before Midsund I found a campsite. The owner was so impressed by where I was going from and to that he gave me a free night. He also gave me a ferry timetable with prices! Amazing. How I've longed for advance knowledge of the prices. The campsite was quite busy with young people as it turned out Midsund was hosting a music festival tonight. He said it was Norwegian folk music. Is that what Norwegian young people are into? Anyway, their noise didn't bother me. I had a shower (10 krones) and WiFi. With the gift, I was within today's budget.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017032.html">Cake by the ocean </a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-14T23:00+0100 " datetime="2017-07-14T23:00+0100 ">Friday 14th Jul 2017 (22:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I packed up the inside of my tent before donning my heat net and braving the midges. I left my little woodland camp spot and hit the road. About 500m down the road I saw a sign for the campsite. Typical. At least I'd saved the cost.</p>
				
				<p>The weather improved just as Marte had suggested it would. I arrived at the ferry to blue skies. It took me over to Selvika for about 38 krones. A few kilometres later I found a Bilateral and took them the old camping gas canisters. The claim from hundreds of kilometres away that I'd get some deposit back turned out not to be the gas. At least I'd got rid of them. I was able to buy a new cannister and some new break pads.</p>
				
				<p>On the way into Kristiansund, a Norwegian man on a folding bicycle showed me the way. He left me in the centre and suggested the tourist office might be up the hill. I went up the hill but couldn't find it. Went around the town a couple of times. It turned out the office was just a little booth on the waterfront.</p>
				
				<p>The lady in the booth thought the only way out of Kristiansund was through the tunnel and bikes weren't allowed. She said I should get a bus from the bus station. After Marte the day before, Kristiansund's tourist office was a major disappointment.</p>
				
				<p>At the bus station they said it probably wasn't expensive and might be 91 krones (!) but I should check with the driver. Why is the bus station uncertain about the price? The bus station?! Nobody in Norway seems to know the price in advance. Ughh. The would leave me nothing for food. Rather than get the bus from the bus station (it is cheating to cross land not under my own steam) I rode to the mouth of the tunnel. There was a bus stop. It suggested you could take a taxi for 100 krones or take a bus for an unspecified amount. It also didn't tell you the bus times. There was a number you could call (I can't) or a website to visit (my Internet phone's battery is failing). A lady and her young son arrived at the bus stop. She heard me chuntering about the price. She was originally from Lithuania and had lived here for seven years. She apologised for Norway being so expensive. It clearly isn't her fault. I was particularly despondent about it because of being tired (I haven't had a rest day in two weeks), hungry (everything is expensive), and still damp after what feels like weeks of being wet through. The extremely kind lady insisted on paying for the bus fare for me. Thank you to her. Once I get home I'll be donating that amount <a href="http://justgiving.com/RTWbike/">to MSF</a> in lieu.</p>
				
				<p>Through the tunnel I was still annoyed about the price and the fact that there was apparently no alternative. Also the fact that it only cost cars 100 krones to get through. So much for Norway encouraging green travel. It left me in a bad mood for the 20 km around the next island.</p>
				
				<p>When I finally reached the Atlantic Highway the view managed to change my mood. This was the view from the tourist brochures. I had the blue skies too. I'd been planning to go to Bud but decided to camp here. I found my own little hill between the road and the ocean where the grass was already flattened from a previous occupant. It was idyllic aside from being buzzed by a couple of drone planes (hopefully they didn't catch me having a wee). There weren't even any midges or flies to ruin the moment. I had dinner of pasta then ate an entire Rullekake with a cup of tea. I watched the sun set. That was the first I've properly seen since the start of my trip. Perfect.</p>
