				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017008.html">To the end of the world</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-20T17:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-20T17:00+0100">Tuesday 20th Jun 2017 (16:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>The Hurtigruten arrived in Mehamn harbour a little late. There were three of us getting on. It was like a ghost ship but then it was 1am. I sat in a lovely comfy chair on the viewing deck and drifted between sleep and worrying that I'd missed my stop. At 5.30 we pulled into Honningsv&aring;g and bus loads of tourists disembarked to visit Nordkapp. I was the only bike getting off but not the only bike visiting the Cape today.</p>
				
				<p>I headed out of town and cooked myself two eggs and porridge (separately) by the side of a fjord. Then, about 8am, I headed up the road to Nordkapp. Up was the right word. There were a series of 200-300m climbs along the 25km road with snow and clagg above 200 or so metres again. This road was much busier than the past few days as camper vans, cars, and buses made their way to a point notable for being the northern-most point of Europe. </p>
				
				<p>The final 1 km had a big drop down to the ocean on the side. The exposure made me stick to the middle of the road in case of a gust of wind. Riding up the final 500m took me to a ticket booth where I was waved through because I'd arrived by a sustainable means of transport (it is free for walkers too). I headed to the globe monument and got a picture of my bike. I've taken its picture next to quite a few landmarks now.</p>
				
				<p>I went into the visitor centre to warm up and dry off. Every layer of clothes was wet either from sweat or rain. I had an expensive cup of coffee and a plate-sized waffle. Then I visited the shop and panic bought a new waterproof jacket as mine is no longer doing the job (the past 24 hours have sure been expensive). I then went to watch the panoramic film about Nordkapp and visited the exhibition. Having somewhere to warm up at the end of the world was very welcome even if I didn't really dry out.</p>
				
				<p>Eventually I had to venture back out into the cold but now with an extra jacket. On the way back I knew what to expect of the road so it felt easier. At the end of the tough section, a few km from Honningsv&aging;g, I decided to stay in a campsite. It was expensive (210 NOK as it is in tourist land) but every piece of clothing I had seemed to be wet and I wanted the use of a dryer. I had really overspent today.</p>
				
				<p>I dried my clothes (20 NOK) and made full use of the kitchen. I chatted with a couple from The Netherlands who had cycled all the way from home.</p>
				
				<p>I may not have cycled far today but at least I was now warm, dry, and fed.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-19T23:14+0100" datetime="2017-06-19T23:14+0100">Monday 19th Jun 2017 (22:14 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I work to the sound of rain pattering on my tent at 6am and went back to sleep. At 8.30 it was still going on. I had to pack up my tent from the inside and head to the little kitchen to make breakfast. After another chat with the Swiss guy, I eventually got a late start. Had I not learned how hard progress is in Norway?</p>
				
				<p>I rode around fjords and over small hills. I wished I hadn't filled my 10 litre water carrier but I didn't want to run out. Although, that clearly wasn't likely today. At Lebesby I stopped to get a small coffee and waffle then bought food in the adjoining shop. A loaf of bread costs about &pound;3. The lady at the checkout told me the rain would last until Wednesday.</p>
				
				<p>I then headed on around the headland and along another fjord. Then the road started going up. There was a raised barrier that indicated this road could be closed in winter. Up I rode to snowy uplands like yesterday. Only this time it was raining and the clay was down to about 200 metres altitude. It got cold. I had no idea how long this stretch of upland would last. I couldn't even see a view. So much for this being the 'scenic' route. Eventually I saw a man up ahead. He was removing the red poles that mark the edge of the road in winter. He told me this was pretty much the top and that it would head down to Hopseidet before another upland stretch. He warned that snow was due tomorrow. The weather forecast had changed in 30km.</p>
				
				<p>Hopseidet turns out to be a little sliver of land that stops Halv &Ouml;ya being an island. It had a little toilet block that sat between two fjords. One toilet also had a radiator so I tried to dry my sodden gloves after wringing them out. So much for being waterproof. I made some sandwiches and some soup sat in the toilet doorway (it was still raining). At this point a little red car stopped and the driver asked if I was OK. He insisted he would go get me some "plastic gloves" and returned a few minutes later with some old industrial rubber gloves like you might use on a fishing trawler. He said the were to be a gift from SalMar. Thanks. </p>
				
				<p>My glove benefactor then suggested I head to Mehamn instead of Kj√∏llefjord as it was 12 km shorter. As I neared the top of the 240m hill he pulled up alongside me. It seems he wanted to check I was OK again even though it was the opposite direction for him. I thanked him and headed on. About 19km of cold rainy clang on, I reached a fork in the road. Even the rubber gloves had started to get cold water in them so I headed to Mehamn. It would cost me double on the Hurtigruten ferry but I wasn't sure I'd survive the cold otherwise.</p>
				
				<p>I saw a "Mehamn 9km" sign and then the real downhill started. That made me happy but it also meant a chilling wind from the speed.</p>
				
				<p>I rolled into Mehamn and saw a shop was open. They were advertising ice-cream and a "brain freezer". It mostly sold chilled items. I walked out in search of something warm. I found a Coop and bought food for tomorrow then headed to the Hurtigruten port. There I found a warm little waiting room. It was empty. I put my clothes on the back of chairs and my shoes on a radiator to dry out. I slowly started to thaw.</p>
				
				<p>The ferry is at 1am. There is nobody here so I don't know what to do about a ticket. The website doesn't seem to have an option for bikes. I shall wait in the hope a person turns up at the little office. My daily budget is well and truly blown today (by a factor of four) but at least I don't have frostbite.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-18T22:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-18T22:00+0100">Sunday 18th Jun 2017 (21:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I sleep better on night two but still don't get a full night's sleep. I have porridge with banana and Nutella for breakfast then pack up and start off at 10am.</p>
				
				<p>Overnight I downloaded Open Street Map for Norway for the Orux Maps app that I still have from Osijek in Croatia. That gives me a map at least even if not on my Garmin. One step at a time.</p>
				
				<p>I cycle to the end of the fjord, by a small 
				village, and on to Varangerbotn. I'd been 
				hoping to get some food there but it is 
				small and everything is shut. Ah, of 
				course! It's Sunday. So I head on to Tana 
				Bru where everything is closed apart from a 
				MAX which is a shop/motel. I order a 
				chicken pannini and a small portion 
				of chips which comes to around &pound;8.50! 
				As everyone says, Norway is expensive.</p>
				
				<p>After lunch I head north along another fjord. I finally see a sign that tells me it is 80km to Ifjord where I thought I'd aim for today. The route bends westward and I climb over hills and down to another fjord. Then up hills and down to another. Then up a hill that seems to keep going up and takes me to the snow covered uplands. I see reindeer. They ignore the cars and buses so much so that drivers have to honk their horns to get them to move. Meanwhile a bicycle is so unusual (especially one with a singing human) that they all scarper in fright as I get anywhere near.</p>
				
				<p>The snowy tops seem to keep going on and on. I remind myself not to be worried about the sun going down (it won't) but I do wonder if the weather might turn. I wouldn't want to be stranded up here in a blizzard. Eventually the serious downhill starts and I get to experience the joy of speeding down an empty, well surfaced, winding road singing at the top of my voice (I started doing this in America to scare off bears but it is now a habit).</p>
				
				<p>Ifjord turns out to be tiny but it has a campsite.  Despite the 180 krones cost for a tent pitch, I'd quite like a shower and washing facilities so I check in. As I wash my dishes a Swiss man, touring Scandinavia in a camper van, asks me about my bike and trip. He says the snow I encountered was unusually late this year. Afterwards, a Swedish man chats to me in a mix of English,  Swedish, and German. He mainly seems to be asking about my brakes and gears as he saw me in Tana Bru and wonders how I got up over the snowy plateau.</p>
				
				<p>It has been another good but tiring day. Given the slow going, I may follow Canute's advice from yesterday and adjust my route. Rather than go south around a huge fjord, I will go north to Kj&oslash;llefjord then take the Hurtigruten ferry to Honningsv&aring;g. If I get the 3am ferry (one per day) on 20th, I should make the Solstice at Nordkapp. </p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-17T22:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-17T22:00+0100">Saturday 17th Jun 2017 (21:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I cycled back to the campsite and filled up my water carrier with water. Then it was back to the airport and finally onto new roads. I road to my first fjord. I was going to have to cycle miles around it.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped for a late lunch and a road-side picnic spot where I promptly lost my camping knife after its first use. Too many things were going wrong in a short space of time. My GPS had decided not to show me the maps of Norway I'd made and which had been accessible back home. It was now pretty much useless for navigation (just for logging where I'd been). My on-the-go card reader had decided it wasn't going to read SD cards despite the fact it had worked fine at home. We're the Russians stopping my technology from over the border? Was there some kind of weird magnetic rock in Kirkenes affecting my electronics? Did I have gremlins? Was I just unlucky? An answer doesn't help, unfortunately. I still have to make do. Thankfully there aren't many roads so navigation isn't too hard right now. I could make do without getting pictures off my camera as I'd done on other trips. I'd survive.</p>
				
				<p>As I reached the end of the fjord I saw a cyclist going the opposite direction. I stopped. So did he. He turned out to be Helmuth who had ridden from Denmark. He was on the last day of his trip and was going to meet his wife in Kirkenes. After a nice chat we both carried on our respective journeys.</p>
				
				<p>It is slow going this time. Partly that is because I have extra weight in my kit and partly because of the hills. It also doesn't help that I can't keep track of how far I have to go on my GPS. My guesses don't take into account how winding the roads can be.</p>
				
				<p>At 96km in I start looking for somewhere to camp. I can't quite find anywhere not rocky or lumpy or windy or far enough away from a house (you have to be 150). One spot I see already has a camper van in it. I finally find my spot at the 120km mark which is handily how far I'd hoped to go today. It still has the cold north easterly wind but I angle my tent so the opening is sheltered. </p>
				
				<p>I have dinner and some tea while admiring the not-a-sunset (because the sun doesn't set this far north).</p>
				
				<p>My tent keeps out the wind, but I still wrap up warm in my sleeping bag. During the "night" the sun stays shining and that helps keep the temperature up too.</p>
