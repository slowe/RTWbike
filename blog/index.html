				<h2 class="title"><a href="0043.html">Roaming in Wyoming</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-19T20:58:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-19T20:58:00+PDT">Monday 19th May 2014 (20:58 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I headed back towards town then south under the I-80. I stopped at the Forest Service Ranger Station to ask about the road to Piedmont. Apparently it was clear of snow but was dirt/gravel. </p>
				
				<p>I was a month into my phone service so had to call their automated line for my sim card renewal. <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/468406978557931521">It wanted my zip code</a>. It really wanted a zip code. It eventually realised I didn't have one and put me through to a real person who could cope with non-Americans.</p>

				<p>I headed to Hilliard and stopped at the historic markers. To a little beyond a reservoir the road was paved but it then turned to gravel/dirt. For the next few miles the road passed between occasional buildings. It wound its way around the landscape following some of the old railroad grade - the railroad had later been shortened by 10 miles when they built two tunnels so this section had been abandoned after Stevens' time.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119468040"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3797/14119468040_c9e4d345ff_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Road towards Piedmont" /></a><figcaption>Road towards Piedmont</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At Piedmont - named by two Italian women - I saw some old, broken down, buildings but wasn't sure of their age. There were three charcoal kilns and I had lunch there. Apparently Calamity Jane had lived in Piedmont and Butch Cassidy had left from here to rob a bank.</p>

				<p>The road curved around to meet the I-80 again and I saw the only sheep I'd seen in America. They didn't seem to know what to do with a cyclist. I baaed at them but they may not have recognised my British vowel sounds.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119484550"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3807/14119484550_02bf44eaca_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Sheep crossing" /></a><figcaption>Sheep crossing</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I stayed on frontage road (marked with the Old Lincoln Highway "L") along the side of the freeway up a steep, long hill onto the top of a flat mountain. Most of the hills around here look like they've had the tops sliced off. It seems to be that the tops were originally a flat plain that has slowly eroded away. Up on this particular flat-topped hill was a huge wind farm and my road went between the turbines.</p>

				<p>I stopped for a rest (and some more Swedish Fish) at the interstate services. A man asked me if I was from California! All through California people thought I was Australian and now someone thought my accent was from California. People seem really bad at placing accents here.</p>
				
				<p>Leaving the services I failed to find the frontage road marked on Open Street Map - the first time it had failed me. At the next intersection I did find a frontage road but it then headed off in the wrong direction leaving me separated from the freeway by a huge carpark and a five foot tall barbed wire fence. I wasn't going backwards so I scaled the fence with my bike. I wasn't sure what the carpark was doing in the middle of nowhere. I'm sure Wyoming folk have their reasons.</p>
				
				<p>There was a fine road into Fort Bridger where I paid the $4 to visit the old trading post where Stevens had stayed. I had a chat with the young woman on the desk who had done a degree in history and was being an intern for the summer. I bought a "sasparilla" mostly because it was something I'd always heard mentioned in cowboy films so wanted to know what it tasted like. It was a tiny bit like a Dandelion & Burdock. I found a house built in 1884 and asked the lady there if she knew which month it was built in as Stevens may have seen it. She wasn't sure but we then talked about my trip.</p>

				<p>Leaving the museum at closing time I headed up to Lyman, through the town and to the KOA ("Kampground of America") where I booked in. I asked the guy at the desk - Reagan - about my next stop (Carter) but he wasn't from Wyoming so didn't know. Later his boss came over and said there were only a few houses there. </p>
				
				<p>Checking my GPS I saw I'd climbed back up to an altitude of 6548 ft which is 1.5 times that of Ben Nevis. I was going to be higher than the entire British Isles throughout Wyoming.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0042.html">Evanston rest day</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-18T20:45:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-18T20:45:00+PDT">Sunday 18th May 2014 (20:45 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>Being ahead of Stevens I had a rest day in Evanston. It wasn't the best day for it as pretty much everywhere except for the motorway services were closed. I walked along the Bear River Greenway. The river itself was in full flow as seems to be expected for May. I wandered around the old town and admiring the now defunct railroad station. It is such a shame that there aren't really passenger services any more.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14306034065"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14306034065_de87a94b56_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Evanston station hasn't been used for passengers in some time" /></a><figcaption>Evanston station hasn't been used for passengers in some time</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I walked up the hill to <em>Subway</em> for lunch. <em>Subway</em> isn't great but it was open and was becoming my most reliable place on the road to get actual vegetable matter. I bought a pink of milk in the services shop only to discover that a US pint is only 473 ml compared to a British 568 ml. Presumably that applies to pints of beer too - Americans are losing out on almost 100 ml!</p>
				
				<p>On-route back to the RV park I stopped to watch some people surfing the standing waves in the Bear River. I sat in the RV park laundry to do some clothes washing and charge my phone. My phone told me I was now "roaming".</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0041.html">Echo Canyon to Evanston</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-17T20:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-17T20:00:00+PDT">Saturday 17th May 2014 (20:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I had to wait once again for the sun to dry the condensation on my tent before I could head back up to Echo Canyon. On the way I cycled by some swan-like birds with huge beaks that I decided must be pelicans.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14305486704"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2914/14305486704_f546d0e55c_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Not swans" /></a><figcaption>Not swans</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>My planned route was along the I-80 but I realised that <em>Echo Canyon Road</em> was an alternative that re-joined the I-80 several miles further along so opted for the quieter option. This turned out to be a good idea as there were several historical markers and I could stop to take pictures. For some reason one side is green and hilly and the other is composed of steep cliffs of orange rock rising up into the vivid blue skies like the hulls of giant ocean liners ploughing into the green swell of the ocean.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14305426554"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3731/14305426554_6070dcfc1a_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Echo Canyon" /></a><figcaption>Echo Canyon</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>The rock is an aggregate that has been at the bottom of some ancient lake or sea. At one pont I spotted a bunch of climbers so stopped and went to take with them. I met Bruce sheltering under a little overhang in the one tiny bit of shade from the late morning sun. He told me they were warming up as, later, they were going to a shaded cave back down the canyon. The routes they were climbing were all bolted as there wasn't really anywhere to put in your own protection. Bruce introduced me to Holly, Chip and another guy. Holly was belaying and I was confused why she was facing the wall rather than looking up at her partner. It turned out she had special <a href="http://cubelayglasses.co.uk/">prism/mirror glasses</a> that let her see vertically upwards. They were called "a belayer's friend" as they relieved the crick in the neck from looking up. After an hour of admiring their climbing, they packed up to go to their main climb and I cycled onwards.</p>

				<p>The canyon had so many spectacular views that my progress was slowed by constant photo opportunities. Eventually I rejoined the freeway and did my old routine of coming off at each exit to avoid vehicles crashing into me and for a rest and water stop. I left the railroad's company for a few miles as the freeway went down a different valley. When we met up again I found a frontage road right next to the railroad. Here I found a broken down truck so asked the driver if he needed help. He said someone was on the way and offered me some water.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14282898996"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5479/14282898996_0af9d440d2_c.jpg" alt="photo" title="Horses in Echo canyon" /></a><figcaption>Horses in Echo canyon</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>Five or six miles of rough frontage road later I passed the "Port of Entry" and was over the border into Wyoming with my third full state crossed. The road became paved at the state line and homes started to populate the roadside along with giant billboards along the freeway.</p>
				
				<p>I reached Evanston, stopped at the Flying J Subway for a 52 fluid oz drink! 52 fluid ounces! Who needs that much other than a parched cyclist? As I headed over the hill away from the services Evanston improved in look from industrial scrub to historic downtown.</p>

				<p>Under the railroad and along the Bear River brought me to an RV park where I pitched my tent. I was still the only tenter. I had what was listed as "4 portion" of chicken pasta for dinner.</p>
				
				<p>I chatted to a couple from Colorada with a three legged dog who were going to meet up with relatives in Reno, Nevada. They were the first RV occupants to speak to me during my trip.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0040.html">Canyons, Devil's Slide and the Thousand Mile Tree</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-16T20:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-16T20:00:00+PDT">Friday 16th May 2014 (20:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>Mrs Higginson provided an excellent breakfast and I was presented with a glass jar of honey to take on my trip. Lyne, the Higginson's neighbour, came over to see me off and gave me a good flask that doesn't leak. </p>
				
				<p>My route was to take me into Weber Canyon and, from my trip planning, I'd been unsure if I'd be able to get into this due to there only being an interstate. The Higginsons said it should be fine as it was a short stretch and gave me directions for getting onto it. The start was quite exciting as it involved negotiating the slip roads on the 93 and I-84. I then had a headwind dropping my speed to under 10 mph. Handily, there were road works through most of the canyon so I was able to be in the coned off right-hand lane all by myself. Being in the works access lane was a lot safer than being in the single remaining lane of a freeway for 3-4 miles.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14282927796"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/14282927796_2886ece7ac_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Looking back to Weber Canyon" /></a><figcaption>Looking back to Weber Canyon</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At Mountain Green I hit alternate roads and had a message from the Higginsons who'd driven through Weber Canyon to check I'd got through OK. It is so lovely to have locals checking that you are safe. The alternate road had the familiar <em>L</em> signs showing me I was back on the Old Lincoln Highway.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14305412034"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3825/14305412034_c57e41a145_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="The Lincoln Highway" /></a><figcaption>The Lincoln Highway</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>A few miles later I had to rejoin the freeway. At Devil's Slide there was a handy parking area where I stopped to view the rock formation and briefly talked to some drivers. One had a fishing rod and claimed the river had the best fishing in the state.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14302646381"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3793/14302646381_0ab7ba5b15_c.jpg" alt="photo" title="Devil's Slide" /></a><figcaption>Devil's Slide</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>A little further on, after a sign for Croyden, I spotted a conspicuous tree. This must be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Mile_Tree">Thousand Mile Tree</a> that Stevens had mentioned which marked a thousand miles of railroad line from Omaha, Nebraska. Actually, it wasn't the same tree because the one Stevens saw was close to dead after being filled with pot shots from passengers. It had died by 1900 but in 1982 the Union Pacific planted a replacement. Following track straightening it was now only 960 miles from Omaha.</p>

				<p>Out of the canyon, and as I got back onto state roads, I was tooted and waved at by a biker gang driving along the freeway. I smiled and gave a cheery wave back. Out here in the West it seems there is a mutual respect amongst those on two wheels.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped at a local mini-mart named <em>Grumps</em> (they're on Facebook!) for some supplies and carried on to Echo via <a href="http://geology.utah.gov/geosights-the-witches-summit-county-utah/">Witch Rocks</a> - named by a US army captain who decided they looked like a coven of witches. At the information point there was a handy sign telling me all about snakes. I took a photo of it for future reference.</p>

				<p>At Echo there didn't seem much sign of accommodation so I carried on around the corner, under the freeway, and along the edge of a reservoir to <em>Echo Resort</em>. This was a "campground" but, as usual, it was for RVs. Lesley, a lady sat outside the reception, told me this part was stoney so I should go a mile or so down to the south site and just go around the locked gate. She didn't charge me and, if anyone asked, I was to say that Lesley had said it was OK. I didn't really know if Lesley had the authority to say this but followed her instructions anyway. I set up my tent 50 metres form the shore hoping this would be enough to stop the mosquitoes. With no toilet/shower facilities I had to bury my business in the sand. My old friend the I-80 had caught up with me again (I last saw it at Oasis in Nevada) and was on the other side of the reservoir. It could be heard all through the night.</p>
