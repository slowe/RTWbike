				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-10-16T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-10-16T23:59+0200">Monday 16th Oct 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I woke and packed my tent. I was at the little campsite reception ready for it to open. I was still tired and I knew I needed to get this sorted and away. My head was filled with thoughts that today was when I would finally reach my destination of the past four months. I was trying to ignore the issue of cycling perhaps 180 km to M&aacute;laga in time for the flight on Wednesday night.</p>

				<p>The daytime man opened the reception. I needed to get my passport back. It wasn't the friendly, French-speaking, man of the night before. Daytime man didn't speak any language that I did so communication was hard. He seemed to be wanting me to pay for the camping. We had to go through a pantomime of me trying to point out that he already had my money (my &euro;10 was paperclipped to my paperwork). It turned out that had been a deposit for the key fob I'd been given to leave. Eventually he was convinced to keep that as payment (I didn't persist to get the few cents change I was due). As I was about to go he reminded me to hand over the key fob. I was clearly barely functional at this point. I was just glad to be going.</p>
				
				<p>On leaving the campsite compound (every campsite seems to be safe from zombie attack in Spain and Portugal) I was back in the wind. IT. WAS. SO. WINDY. This was the edge of Hurricane Ophelia that was currently heading up towards Ireland. I'd been hoping that would mean the wind was from the west but, as always, it seemed to give me a 20-30 mph gusty wind from the east. My last day would be against strong wind.</p>
				
				<p>A kilometre or two down the road, at Zahara, were two campsites that were clearly open. So much for my worries about a lack of campsites last night. There was a little Coviran supermarket where I stopped for supplies. </p>

				<p>I headed along the coast past Trafalgar (yes, that one) to Los Ca&ntilde;os de Meca. Here my GPS seemed to suggest there was a coastal path. I went to the start of it. It was sand. Probably passable if you were on a wide-wheeled mountain bike with no luggage but I wasn't. I headed back to the main road. It went up to 135 metres through a Parque Natural before dropping down to Barbate. After stopping at Lidl, I had flat roads for a while. That was good because I was also fighting the wind. On this stretch the nice looking beach was off limits as it seemed to be a military area. </p>

				<p>At Zahara de los Atunes my path took me inland as the coast road didn't seem to join up south of Atlanterra. Giant wind turbines came into view. They were spread across the landscape ahead of me like an army. They were all faced in the same direction - the way I was headed - and were spinning fast for structures of their size. Great. The elements were really trying to give me one last obstacle to endure to make me earn the end.</p>

				<p>Heading north east meant the wind was partially from the side. That meant I had to keep stopping myself being pushed into passing cars. It took a lot of effort. It felt as though the wind was trying to sap every last tiny drop of physical and mental energy from me.</p>
				
				<p>Eventually the road took a 90 degree turn and headed south east. That still had the same problem with being pushed sideways but with the added problem of the wind suddenly stopping everytime a vehicle went by me. When you're leaning into the wind to stop it blowing you off the road and then it suddenly stops, you very nearly fall over in the other direction. Eventually, I had to get off and walk despite it being flat. Here I met Stefan who had cycled from Cologne in Germany. He had been forced to walk too. He wasn't sure if he would reach Tarifa today.</p>

				<p>Closer to Facinas the mountains provided a little sheilding and I was able to get back on my bike. I must have climbed uphill as I now had a pleasant downhill giving me a little break.</p>
				
				<p>Tarifa was approaching. I was close to collapse. I would reach it. I would. But first I'd stop in a supermarket to buy calories.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DMQ3DLDXkAAIaIr.jpg" alt="landscape" title="Nearly there" /><figcaption>Nearly there</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>There was a sign marking Tarifa. I wasn't quite there. Along the sea front I rode. Surfers were enjoying the breaking waves and riding the tubes. I reached the narrow spit that joins Tarifa to the little military island of Isla de Las Palomas. Ignoring the "no vehicles" sign, I rode along it to the end. There was a rather dishevelled sign marking the southernmost point of mainland Europe. I was here.</p>
				
				<p>I had set off 120, long, days ago from Kirkenes. I had endured snow, freezing rain, hills, rain, midges, bike breakages, rain, exhaustian, and so much head wind. But I was here. On one side was the wild water of the Atlantic ocean. On the other was the Mediterranean. All the emotion of four months of effort welled up. I sat down and cried. I had ridden the Atlantic coast of Europe. It was mine.</p>

				<p>I found a more sheltered spot and sat down to eat. I also found out the press conference about the latest gravitational wave discovery was happening too. I wasn't really taking it in though. I'd just cycled the Atlantic coast of Europe.</p>
				
				<p>After a longer rest than normal (hey, I felt it had been earned) I realised I'd have to press on to eat up some of the 180 kilometres I needed to do to get to M&aacute;laga. In Tarifa I bought a ridiculous number of postcards then headed uphill and out of town. The road kept going uphill. Argh. At least the wind wasn't as fierce as it had been this morning. The effort felt similar. Eventually I reached 325m altitude then it was downhill... for a little bit until the road went back up to 325m again. Then I got to enjoy a good, long, freewheel down into Algeciras in time for sunset.</p>
				
				<p>In Algeciras I found a Hostal. The man on reception spoke good English which was helpful given how exhausted I was. He asked for my passport. I reached into my handle bar bag and... it wasn't there. Panic filled my body. Where was it? The receptionist, </p>
				
				<p>In my fatigue I had to give my passport to the camping person last night. This morning, in the exchange with a new person, I didn't get it.</p>
				
				<p>I only realised now that I need it tonight. This is why I don't like giving ID to camping/hostels. I knew this would happen at some point.</p>
				
				<p>So, tomorrow, I have to go back to the campsite I was in last night. And then come back to here and on to Málaga. This is increasingly hard.</p>
				
				<p>I cannot cope with this.</p>
				
				<p>Really. I do not have the time or energy to fit this all in.</p>
				
				<p>Or money</p>
				
				<p>Last night's campsite are extremely non-proactive in helping. Doesn't help that they don't speak English and I don't speak Spanish. 1/n</p>
				
				<p>The man on the reception in the hostel tonight rang then for me. They left it to him to help me. He suggested a bus. There is no direct bus</p>
				
				<p>And there are only two buses a day from this side (no idea about return). One is at 8am other at 3pm.</p>
				
				<p>I'd have to hope they let me take my bike to be able to get to the campsite from the other end. I wouldn't bet on that given UK bus/coach.</p>
				
				<p>Plus, even if that option works with zero problems it'll likely take all Tuesday.</p>
				
				<p>I suggested a delivery service of some kind. The reception guy kindly tried looking online. It needs a call to a human to check if they can</p>
				
				<p>deliver it to Málaga by Wednesday afternoon. They have no humans available until 10am. Helpful reception man finishes his shift at 8am</p>
				
				<p>The lady who takes over at 8am speaks no English.</p>
				
				<p>I am unlikely to be able to hire a car without my passport (I have my driving licence).</p>
				
				<p>Even with the delivery service I fully expect is that they'd require my passport to pick up my passport. Computer says no style.</p>
				
				<p>If only the campsite could give it to some people in a camper van heading this way tomorrow.</p>
				
				<p>I am utterly utterly exhausted and am out of ideas. I know I can't cycle 360 km in a day and a half. That won't happen.</p>
				
				<p>Is anyone with a vehicle going by El Palmar (south of Concil de La Frontera) tomorrow heading to Algeciras or Málaga? Anyone?</p>
				
				<p>Seriously, I CANNOT cycle an *extra* 200 km. I have cycled 10 (?) days and 1100 km since my last rest day.</p>
				
				<p>Perhaps it is useful to point out I am much more mentally and physically exhausted than you think. Even more than that.</p>
				
				<p>Thanks for all the questions. I am no longer able to provide answers. In dealing with this and questions I haven't had chance to eat.</p>
				
				<p>And am too exhausted to work out how I can eat at 10pm in a place I don't know never mind move to do so.</p>
				
				<p>Also folks, realise I am trying to simultaneously answer questions from several people.</p>
				
				<p>Thanks to the people trying to take the mental load off me.</p>
				
				<p>Solutions need to account for me hardly being able to think (why do you think I left my passport?) and I have a big awkward bicycle.</p>
				
				<p>Buses, trains, planes, taxis, catamarans etc often don't take bikes. Usually best to assume they don't unless they explicitly say they do.</p>
				
				<p>I can't concentrate any more. Night.</p>
				
				<p>Does DHL? How? Incoherent.</p>

				<p>I woke before dawn. It'd be nice not to have multiple insect bites every day. I'm constantly itchy in new places. It'd also be nice if ants stopped trying to get in my tent and stuff overnight.</p>
				
				<p>After a hard ride against the wind (which picked up overnight) I reached Rota in time for the 10am ferry. Except there wasn't a 10am ferry; it was Sunday. I'd forgotten. So I waited for the 11.25am ferry over to C&aacute;diz. I got a coffee from a nearby cafe. The ticket office opened at 10.45 and it turned out the ferry was replaced by a bus service thanks to the strong winds (presumably due to Hurricane Ophelia). I can't take the bus replacement as that would be cheating. So I decided to miss C&aacute;diz and push on against the wind.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DMMuIgjW4AA_hdb.jpg" alt="landscape" title="Windy Rota" /><figcaption>Windy Rota</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>The next hour or so after Rota I had a really tough time cycling into strong wind. It was like being in a sand blaster. I hoped this didn't continue all day.</p>

				<p>I reached El Puerto de Santa Maria and found that that ferry <em>was</em> running. So I made it to C&aacute;diz after all. It was cheaper too.</p>

				<p>In C&aacute;diz I asked the Tourist Information Office for advice on cycling south out of the city. Then I found an open Carrefour Express and had lunch. I gave a homeless man one of the sandwiches I made. He turned out to be from Germany. He fed part of the sandwich to the pigeons. The bread was on the way to stale. I ate mine.</p>
				
				<p>Time was getting on and so must I. Back into the heat and wind to find a mythical, bike-navigable, route south. Why are there so many motorway class roads all over the place? They are annoying.</p>

				<p>I hadn't gone 100km today but I had to stop. The next campsite finished its season last night. The next one after that was too far to get to in the gale before dark. The one I'd arrived at had a big closed gate though. I tried calling the number but a man answered it and when I couldn't speak in Spanish he hung up. Drat. What would I do? As I sat on the ground a car pulled up and opened the gate. I thought these people might work here. They didn't. They were campers too. Never mind. I would camp now and pay in the morning.</p>
				
				<p>After putting up my tent and having a shower I discovered the reception was currently open. I handed over my passport and &euro;10. I was official.</p>

				<p>My alarm went off an hour late because I still hadn't updated my phone.</p>

				<p>I arrived at Matalasca&ntilde;as in good time. Google maps and various blogs had told me I now needed to head almost to Seville to cross the river before heading back to the coast. So I rode 15km inland to El Rocio. At the Tourist Information Office, a ranger named Sonja told me I could shorten my trip by going back to the coast and going 32 km along the beach. I was dubious. My bike doesn't get along with sand. Would I sink? Sonja said she did it years ago on a racing bike with panniers. She said you had to do it after high tide on the wet sand. We checked the tide times. High tide was 11:50am. The timing seemed perfect. It did mean going 15 km back the way I'd just been and another 15 km back if it looked no good. But, it would shave off perhaps 100 km from the inland detour. I decided to risk it. It might get me to Cadiz today.</p>

				<p>I rode back to Matalasa&ntilde;as and got to the beach. The first 10 km proved to be tough going. I largely had to walk my bike as my wheels kept sinking. After that it became easier. Either because the beach was better or the tide was out more or both.</p>

				<p>David and I were off by 9.15am. We kept a fast pace up for the next couple of hours before stopping to buy (and eat) some jicy oranges from a roadside stand. Then we rode to the border and caught the ferry over the river. I think David was happy to be back in Spain after 12 days. He had cycled 1142 km and the entire coast of Portugal.</p>

				<p>Back on Spanish soil we headed on. We were immediately faced with a 20% gradient hill which was tough after a few days of gentle roads. We raced on to Lepe where David was meeting a friend who had driven down to give him a lift home. They were going to have a couple of days break first. We shared beers at a bar in the centre and then said our farewells. It has been really nice to share the last day or so with David. I think he is planning a much longer trip in the future. Perhaps we'll meet again on the road some day.</p>

				<p>I lost an hour crossing the border. I prefer to think of it as giving back the hour I was given when entering Portugal. I updated one of my phones but forgot the other.</p>
				
				<p>I was now riding on alone. At the next town I visited a Carrefour and then sat eating food for an hour. Eventually I realised my phone I'd been checking for the time was an hour out and I really needed to move on. Back into the fierce heat I cycled after applying more suncream.</p>

				<p>I reached the campsite in Mazag&oacute;n just before sunset as has become the norm in the last week. It was &euro;7 and was really popular. The first spot I tried to pitch my tent was awful. Just under a surface of loose sand was concrete. Tent pegs don't work in those conditions.</p>
