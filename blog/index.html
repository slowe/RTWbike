				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-18T22:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-18T22:00+0100">Sunday 18th Jun 2017 (21:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I sleep better on night two but still don't get a full night's sleep. I have porridge with banana and Nutella for breakfast then pack up and start off at 10am.</p>
				
				<p>Overnight I downloaded Open Street Map for Norway for the Orux Maps app that I still have from Osijek in Croatia. That gives me a map at least even if not on my Garmin. One step at a time.</p>
				
				<p>I cycle to the end of the fjord, by a small 
				village, and on to Varangerbotn. I'd been 
				hoping to get some food there but it is 
				small and everything is shut. Ah, of 
				course! It's Sunday. So I head on to Tana 
				Bru where everything is closed apart from a 
				MAX which is a shop/motel. I order a 
				chicken pannini which and a small portion 
				of chips which comes to around &pound;8.50! 
				As everyone says, Norway is expensive.</p>
				
				<p>After lunch I head north along another fjord. I finally see a sign that tells me it is 80km to Ifjord where I thought I'd aim for today. The route bends westward and I climb over hills and down to another fjord. Then up hills and down to another. Then up a hill that seems to keep going up and takes me to the snow covered uplands. I see reindeer. They ignore the cars and buses so much so that drivers have to honk their horns to get them to move. Meanwhile a bicycle is so unusual (especially one with a singing human) that they all scarper in fright as I get anywhere near.</p>
				
				<p>The snowy tops seem to keep going on and on. I remind myself not to be worried about the sun going down (it won't) but I do wonder if the weather might turn. I wouldn't want to be stranded up here in a blizzard. Eventually the down starts and I get to experience the joy of speeding down an empty, well surfaced, winding road singing at the top of my voice (I started doing this in America to scare off bares but it is now a habit).</p>
				
				<p>Ifjord turns out to be tiny but it has a campsite.  Despite the 180 krones cost for a tent pitch, I'd quite like a shower and washing facilities so I check in. As I wash my dishes a Swiss man touring Scandinavia in a camper van asks me about my bike and trip. He says the snow I encountered was unusually late this year. After, a Swedish man chats to me in a mix of English,  Swedish, and German. He mainly seems to be asking about my brakes and gears as he saw my in Tana Bru and wonders how I got up over the snowy plateau.</p>
				
				<p>It had been another good but tiring day. Given the slow going, I may follow Canute's advice from yesterday and adjust my route. Rather than go south around a huge fjord, I will go north to Kj&oslash;llefjord then take the Hurtigruten ferry to Honningsv&aring;g. If I get the 3am ferry (one per day) on 20th, I should make the Solstice at Nordkapp. </p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-17T22:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-17T22:00+0100">Saturday 17th Jun 2017 (21:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I cycled back to the campsite and filled up my water carrier with water. Then it was back to the airport and finally onto new roads. I road to my first fjord. I was going to have to cycle miles around it.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped for a late lunch and a road-side picnic spot where I promptly lost my camping knife after its first use. Too many things were going wrong in a short space of time. My GPS had decided not to show me the maps of Norway I'd made and which had been accessible back home. It was now pretty much useless for navigation (just for logging where I'd been). My on-the-go card reader had decided it wasn't going to read SD cards despite the fact it had worked fine at home. We're the Russians stopping my technology from over the border? Was there some kind of weird magnetic rock in Kirkenes affecting my electronics? Did I have gremlins? Was I just unlucky? An answer doesn't help, unfortunately. I still have to make do. Thankfully there aren't many roads so navigation isn't too hard right now. I could make do without getting pictures off my camera as I'd done on other trips. I'd survive.</p>
				
				<p>As I reached the end of the fjord I saw a cyclist going the opposite direction. I stopped. So did he. He turned out to be Helmuth who had ridden from Denmark. He was on the last day of his trip and was going to meet his wife in Kirkenes. After a nice chat we both carried on our respective journeys.</p>
				
				<p>It is slow going this time. Partly that is because I have extra weight in my kit and partly because of the hills. It also doesn't help that I can't keep track of how far I have to go on my GPS. My guesses don't take into account how winding the roads can be.</p>
				
				<p>At 96km in I start looking for somewhere to camp. I can't quite find anywhere not rocky or lumpy or windy or far enough away from a house (you have to be 150). One spot I see already has a camper van in it. I finally find my spot at the 120km mark which is handily how far I'd hoped to go today. It still has the cold north easterly wind but I angle my tent so the opening is sheltered. </p>
				
				<p>I have dinner and some tea while admiring the not-a-sunset (because the sun doesn't set this far north).</p>
				
				<p>My tent keeps out the wind, but I still wrap up warm in my sleeping bag. During the "night" the sun stays shining and that helps keep the temperature up too.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017004.html">Meeting Canute</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-17T12:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-17T12:00+0100">Saturday 17th Jun 2017 (11:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It turned out the bike I saw at Oslo wasn't 
				mine. It belonged to Canute, a Norwegian 
				teacher who has been cycling the Norwegian 
				coastline in stages. This part was his last 
				one.</p>
				
				<p>After I'd got my bike back together, 
				we cycled together towards Kirkenes. We'd 
				both seen the same campsite on the map. 
				When we arrived the reception was closed 
				and Canute was able to call a number in 
				Norwegian to ask what to do. We were told 
				we could pay at 10am which was a bit late 
				for both of us but we had little choice.</p>
				
				<p>We 
				both pitched our tents, chatted over 
				dinner, and then had a walk up the hill 
				behind the campsite to admire the 11pm Sun 
				and the view. Canute was a great person to 
				have met. Being a teacher who teaches 
				Norwegian to foreigners and asylum seekers 
				meant he was quite a worldly person who 
				could explain peculiarities of Norway to 
				me. I was so lucky to have met him.</p>
				
				<p>As Canute had predicted, I had difficulty sleeping in the midnight sun and had to be woken the next morning at 9.30 by Canute. I quickly packed up, we paid, and headed into Kirkenes. With Canute's help I bought gas for my stove and food supplies for the next few days. A lady at the surprisingly big shopping centre asked me where i was going and did a double take when i said "Spain". We had a little conversation and it turns out Kirkenes translate as "Church on the Ness" which I pointed out was almost Scottish (in Scotland a kirk is a church).</p>
				
				<p>Stocked up, we then headed to the outskirts of Kirkenes and said our goodbyes. I wished him "God Tur" (Norwegian for "have a good journey") and started my ride to the north.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-16T18:00:00+BST" datetime="2017-06-16T18:00:00+BST">Friday 16th Jun 2017 (18:00 BST)</time></div>
				<p>The adventure 
				has begun.</p>
				
				<p>It was an early start this 
				morning. Having packed up all my belongings 
				and stored them with friends (thanks Noel 
				and Anne) and family, I had spent the night 
				at my sister's. This morning she made me 
				porridge, we said our goodbyes, then <a href="">she 
				waved me off</a>.</p>
				
				<p>I rode down to Leeds 
				station to get the 06:52 train to 
				Manchester airport. I'd booked ahead to get 
				a space for my bike but it turned out it 
				was full of luggage and none of the owners 
				wanted to shift them. So I had to stand 
				with my bike for an hour and a half. So 
				much for getting some extra sleep on the 
				train.</p>
				
				<p>At Manchester airport I had to pack 
				my bike into the huge transparent plastic 
				bag for the flight. I sat for ages trying 
				to get the left-hand pedal off. I tried 
				turning both ways but just couldn't budge 
				it. Just as I rang a friend for advice, a 
				guy who'd been in the queue came over and 
				offered a hand. Tom, it turns out, does 
				mountain bike training and he managed to 
				loosen it. Thanks Tom.</p>
				
				<p>After finally 
				getting the bike packed (with bubble wrap 
				over important parts) and my panniers 
				combined into my Ikea bag, I took 
				everything to special baggage. There I met 
				a couple of parkrunners from back home. It 
				turned out they were off to do the midnight 
				marathon in Tromso and were on the same 
				flight to Oslo. It's a small world 
				(although my legs disagree).</p>
				
				<p>On the flight 
				I was sat next to a young couple. One of 
				the guys had an old film camera he'd picked 
				up on eBay for &pound;3. Apparently you can 
				still get film developed at Boots. Who 
				knew? It is great to see they are still 
				getting used but I'm not sure I'd swap my 
				DSLR for one. Half my kit would end up 
				being rolls of film.</p>
				
				<p>Touching down at Oslo 
				airport the scenery said Norway. The hills, 
				the houses, the forests of tall spruce 
				trees stretching up to touch us. After a 
				few hours at Oslo airport I took my second 
				flight on to Kirkenes. A lady at the help 
				desk pronounced it "chirk-i-ness" but 
				various tannoy announcements said it 
				differently so I'm none the wiser. Rather 
				concerningly, as I borded the plane I 
				glimpsed a bike under the plane but it 
				wasn't in a bike bag. Was it mine? I 
				couldn't quite tell. Had something happened 
				to it? Was I going to be stranded with a 
				broken bike? Perhaps I had nothing to worry 
				about. Perhaps someone else was cycling the 
				route. I hoped that was the answer as I 
				nervously drank the little cup of tea they 
				gave me on the flight.</p>
				
				<p>Kirkenes is pretty 
				much the end of Norway. A few miles further 
				and you're in Russia. But that isn't where 
				I'm going. For the next four days I head 
				northward and westward to Nordkapp. The 
				plan is to reach it by the Summer Solstice 
				so that I'm at my most northern point at 
				the same time as the Sun. After that both 
				of us head south.</p>
				
				<p>So, I have over 500km of 
				remote countryside to go in four days. I'll 
				start tomorrow so that I have chance to 
				find supplies in Kirkenes. Most importantly 
				I'll need some gas for my camp stove and 
				food. Plenty of food.</p>
