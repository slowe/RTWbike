				<p>Had two Brits and then a nice lady from Melbourne ask me if I'm from Yorkshire! Then some Italians wanted their picture with me.</p>

				Thanks to everyone for following me across two continents and for tweets of encouragement.</p>
				
				<p>I did my #biketour on my normal bike with only two 40 mile 'training' rides beforehand. I got fitter as I went. Everyone can do it.</p>

				<p>In @stevens1884's day he said the morning calls to prayer woke him at 5am. They seem to be at 3.30am for me.</p>

				<p>A bit stuck. Back tracking.</p>
				
				<p>Had my own seven minutes of terror.</p>
				
				<p>A man in a white van stopped to say hello in Turkish. He wanted me to follow him. I think he is buying me a cola.</p>

				<p>Istanbul cycling can be quite stressful when the bike lanes stop. I've checked into a hostel and had a shower now so feel more relaxed.</p>

				<p>Had a haircut in &Ccedil;orlu. That feels much better. </p>
				
				<p>Just had a guy in a petrol station shout "Bradley Wiggins" to me! :)</p>
				
				<p>
				I know I can only average 6mph in big cities due to lights, traffic, navigation, stress stops. A capital takes the best part of a da</p>
				
				<p>It would be quicker if I knew the streets and drivers but when you are new to them, more care is needed. That takes more time.</p>
				
				<p>The upshot is that I will give myself all day tomorrow to go the last 30 miles. As lots of people have told me, Istanbul requires more care.</p>
				
				<p>Hello Sea of Marmara and... umm... Newport? </p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CIqW8TjUYAA0ns9.jpg:large" alt="landscape" title="Sea of Marmara" /><figcaption>Sea of Marmara</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>In getting my wheel into the Sea of Marmara I also got my shoes wet. At least all the holes let the water back out. ;)</p>

				<p>The last proper shower I had was at the campsite in Bulgaria. Checked in to a cheap hotel in Silivri. It is lovely here.</p>
				
				<p>Oh and I was really glad to get off the D100 a few miles before Silivri as its hard shoulder was getting sketchy and the traffic increasing.</p>
				
				<p>6.22pm It is quite exciting to hear calls to prayer echoing out over the rooftops.</p>
				
				<p>
				Jupiter and Venus were nice and close this evening. Spent time talking to an English teacher.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-28T20:00:00+CEDT" datetime="2015-06-28T20:00:00+CEDT">Sunday 28th Jun 2015 (20:00 CEDT)</time></div>
				<p>Aside from briefly being woken by the musical call-to-prayer at 3.30am, I slept about 12 hours.</p>
				
				<p>200 km to go. Not sure if it is quiet due to Sunday or Ramadan.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CIkpk9YWoAAM-KK.jpg:large" alt="landscape" title="D100 road in Turkey" /><figcaption>D100 road in Turkey</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>So far, in almost every shop I've been in the owner has followed me around. It is slightly disconcerting.</p>
				
				<p>Stopped at what looked like a little cafe with some men outside drinking tea (chai). Bought some then the men bought me a second.</p>
				
				<p>We shared almost no language. There were pantomimic gestures, a few words of German, and I learnt the word for flat in Turkish: d&uuml;z. Brill!</p>
				
				<p></p>
				
				<p><figure class="portrait"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CIlFgHKUMAAwYGY.jpg:large" alt="portrait" title="Western Turkey is starting to feel like Western Iowa but with less corn and a better hard shoulder" /><figcaption>Western Turkey is starting to feel like Western Iowa but with less corn and a better hard shoulder</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I'm going to go ahead of you. I have better roads and want to make the most of the relative quiet today.</p>
				
				<p>I think the rain clouds are surrounding me.</p>
				
				<p>Asked some guys working at a petrol station if there was camping nearby. They're Chelsea fans and are letting me camp around the back!</p>
				
				<p>Behind the petrol station has better ground for tent pegs than the real campsite I stayed in in Edirne! They also showed me the toilet.</p>
				
				<p>No shower here but then I didn't get much of a shower in Edirne because they ran out of water due to filling their pool.</p>
				
				<p>
				I am a little short of &Ccedil;orlu today. I'm going to head for Silivri tomorrow.</p>
