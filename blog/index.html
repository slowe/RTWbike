				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-29T20:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-29T20:00:00+PDT">Thursday 29th May 2014 (20:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I went into Laramie to have a look around. I found the historic part of downtown and started looking for a bike shop. On Front Street I found <a href="http://www.pedalhouse.com/">The Pedal House</a> which was recommended to me by Rick back in Rock Springs. It had a large mural of a man with a penny farthing on the wall outside. I went in and got talking to the man at the front desk. They'd actually heard of Thomas Stevens and the guy showed me pictures of the Laramie Bicycle Club from around that time. He said they were big geeks about this stuff.</p>

				<p>I entrusted my bike to them so they could fix the broken spoke and headed off to get lunch at a vegetarian place - Sweet Melissa - they had recommended a few doors down. I got a large black bean and sweet potato burrito with side salad and root beer. It was so nice to have proper vegetables for the first time since Utah.</p>
				
				<p>Laramie was a lively, studenty, college town. It felt very relaxed and a little bit cool. After a drink at a local coffee shop I headed back to The Pedal House where the mechanics then took a look at my bike. They spotted my handlebars were a bit loose so fixed that. They then let me wash my bike out the back and even fitted a replacement, second-hand, kickstand for me. Local bike shops are brilliant!</p>

				<p>I then headed to Iveson House home of the Laramie Plains Museum. There I arrived just after a tour had started and the lady in the ticket office - the wonderfully named Mary Mountain - ushered me around to join it. She told me I'd be joining another Englishman from London. Inside I was greeted by the Docent, Kim, who was the tour guide. The other tourist was from UCL her on a mathematics conference. Kim told us about the Ivesn family history and the history of the house. It has been beautifully restored using local materials and fixtures from the time. Apparently Mr Iveson married in his 90s and his septagenarian wife took many of the fixtures and fittings to her own house when they divorced soon after. He'd then married a 13 year old who he met on a boat! His banks made lots of money and it showed in the house. In his later years he started giving back to the local community and set up an orphanage, and old ladies home and a hospital. On the third floor (second if you aren't American) there was a penny farthing and a picture of Thomas Stevens!</p>

				<p>Kim set his two tourees a quiz to name the state motto. I had actually been asking people that exact question all through the state and had got a variety of answers. It turned out Vivian from Granger Town Hall was correct; it was "The Equality State" as it was the first government to let women vote in all elections. Kim turned out to be a cyclist himself so I promised a postcard. Mary and RJ in the ticket office/shop got talking to me afterwards.</p>

				<p>I cycled down the street to the university then back to the main street to find an internet cafe with a computer to upload some photos. They made very nice smoothies.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0051.html">Head wind and webcams</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-28T19:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-28T19:00:00+PDT">Wednesday 28th May 2014 (19:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>This morning I visited the <em>Medicine Bow</em> museum which was being looked after by a man who was very hard of hearing.</p>
				
				<p>I tried to wash my bike at the gas station but only removed some of the mud/clay. The going today would have been fine apart from the same fierce head wind from the day before. I could hardly keep up 8 mph despite putting in a lot of effort. Just before <em>Rock River</em> (not to be confused with <em>Rock Springs</em> or <em>Green River</em> where I'd been a few days before) I spotted some solar panels and a camera on a pole. A quick check online showed me that <a href="http://wyoroad.info/highway/webcameras/US30RockRiver/US30RockRiver.html">this was indeed a webcam</a>. I quickly texted and tweeted people back home and told them I'd only wait for 20 minutes as it was too hot to hang around. I'm glad to say that my soon to be nephew-in-law, Dan FM and <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislintott/status/471730038136897536">Chris Lintott managed to grab</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/exoplaneteer/status/471737072521592832/photo/1">screenshots of me</a> to prove I'd been there.</p>

				<p>In Rock River I stopped to get a drink and sweets in the General Store. It turned out that the clerk's son had cycled coast-to-coast in 3 parts. The remaining 37 miles were a slog in the strong wind and blazing heat. I was glad to be approaching Laramie when I spotted a tourer going the other way. We chatted across the road and it turned out he'd set off from the west coast. He had been scared off by the tornadoes in the mid west last week and so was returning back to the west coast!</p>

				<p>Laramie has a population of around 30,000 and was a sight for tired eyes. I checked my tent into the KOA.</p>
				
				<p>Total distance cycled so far: 1489 miles.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0050.html">Rawlins to Medicine Bow</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-27T21:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-27T21:00:00+PDT">Tuesday 27th May 2014 (21:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>This morning I got talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/chipriggs">Chip</a> and Cristin from Florida who had what I would think of as a normal-sized caravan but out here was tiny in comparison to the RVs. They had set off from Florida on April 22 (like me) and were making their way up to Alaska (not like me). We had a good long conversation about all sorts of things and it meant I'd delayed their start (and mine).</p>
				
				<p>After my weekend in Rawlins I tried the bike shop again but it was still closed until "10". I headed down the bike path towards <em>Subway</em> and, whilst waiting to cross a busy road, another bike turned up. Although it initially looked like a motorbike, it was a "snow bike" <a href="https://twitter.com/thejimmyproject/status/468792219177324544">named Denny</a> being ridden by a guy <a href="https://twitter.com/thejimmyproject">Philip Chen</a>. He was cycling up the Rockies from Mexico to Canada so his chunky tyres were probably necessary. He had impressively little in the way of kit and had a bottle of hip-mounted "bear spray" ready to use. He said it would give him 30 seconds. I'm not sure what he would do with that time as bears can out-run bikes. It turned out he'd wanted something from the bike shop too. We had a chat and he told me that long-distance cyclists often got things delivered to rural post offices along their route for collection as they got there.</p>

				<p>I managed to avoid the I-80 out of Rawlins and then took another 'road' that turned out to be nothing more than a track that had a section of the horrible wet clay/mud/rock mixture that sticks to my wheels and breaks. At this point my kick stand broke. I tried to stay positive</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14119589130"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/14119589130_eb1296a47a_c.jpg" alt="photo" title="Leaving Rawlins" /></a><figcaption>Leaving Rawlins</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>Clearing out the clay/mud every few hundred metres, I eventually reached Fort Fred Steele with a view of the lonely Elk Mountain beyond. Unfortunately the rear entrance gate had been padlocked shut despite a sign saying it was open. I unloaded my bike and hoisted it over the gate then did the same with my bags. The historic site was deserted but I signed the visitor book anyway.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14302871221"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5501/14302871221_14b4045be1_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Fort Fred Steele with Elk Mountain beyond" /></a><figcaption>Fort Fred Steele with Elk Mountain beyond</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>After Fort Fred Steele I tried to follow the Old Lincoln Highway over the flooding river but it quickly ended with a barbed wire fence. This was getting familiar. I headed back to the I-80. </p>

				<p>As an aside, my dad had been complaining since San Francisco about the fact he hadn't been able to see me on any webcams. I'm not sure how he expected me to know where the webcams are (they don't usually have a big sign saying "Webcam") and I couldn't say when I'd be anywhere to more than a couple of hours (I could easily get bogged down in the horrible mud stuff). At this point I checked the Wyoming road department website and found there was one at Walcott Junction a few miles up the road. I sent a text message back home to the UK to say I was heading that way.</p>
				
				<p>At Walcott Junction I stopped at the <em>Shell</em> and chatted to the guy at the counter. I said I'd post some UK coins to him (unfortunately I later lost his address). I got an icecream and headed north on the US30 up into a much more hilly region with dark clouds/rain following me from the west. I was worried about the time. I had a long way to go including visiting the ghost town of Carbon. Turning off the US30 towards Carbon I had to go uphill on a rough track into fierce head wind. </p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14302885681"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5194/14302885681_5034fb325d_z.jpg" alt="photo" title="Carbon ghost town" /></a><figcaption>Carbon ghost town</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>There wasn't much to see in Carbon as everything had been removed. There was a sign pointing out where the hotel had been. It was now a small cluster of trees which stood out on the largely treeless landscape. I hoped that after Carbon, when I turned back to the north east, the head wind would help. It would have but I was slowed to a crawl by miles of the clay/mud stuff and several more barbed wire fences. My hands ended up covered in mud from constantly clawing the mud from my breaks and tyres. The sun was setting and thoughts of cougars starting their evening hunting spurred me on. I only just made it, tired and bedraggled, to Medicine Bow as the sun dropped out of sight below the horizon. I checked into the motel part of the famous, and very smokey, Virginian Hotel.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0049.html">A weekend in Rawlins</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-26T17:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-26T17:00:00+PDT">Monday 26th May 2014 (17:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>As it is Memorial weekend I decided to stay in Rawlins, and relative civilization, until Tuesday. Rose gave me some cloths to clean my bike with. These ended up so filthy that she let me keep them. She had also found a bike shop in the phone book so I visited it. They were closed. Their sign said they'd be back "at 10". Tomorrow? Next week? Next year?</p>
				
				<p>At the grocery store I found Italian bread, proscuitto, (American) parmesan and lettuce. Everywhere else seemed closed as it was Sunday.</p>
				
				<p>At the campground I perused the bookshelf in the laundry and read "Are we there yet?" by David Levithan. It was a better read than the biography of Nancy Reagan, a book by Glen Beck and a huge array of paperback westerns. I can't say if it was better than "The World Out of Control: book four" as I couldn't take its crazy title font seriously.</p>
				
				<p>On the Monday I cycled to the bike shop but it was still closed so I visited the Wyoming State Penitentiary. There I paid for the guided tour and went around with a group of 8 people. Our tour guide spoke her well repeated tour quickly and seemed weirdly proud of some of the more macabre facts. She reminded me of the character of Amy Farrah-Fowler in the Big Bang Theory. At one point we saw the gallows and the gas chamber which she encouraged us to sit in. Three of our party did and took selfies. I found it all a bit unsettling because had been killed in that chair within my lifetime.</p>

				<p>At night, as always, I could hear the sounds of the I-80 and the railroad.</p>
