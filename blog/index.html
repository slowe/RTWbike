				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-08-03T22:41+0100" datetime="2017-08-03T22:41+0100">Thursday 03rd Aug 2017 (21:41 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>There was no wind this morning but there also weren't too many midges so taking down my tent was relatively painless. It was wet though.</p>
				
				<p>The next hour or so was on and off heavy showers as I rode along Loch Moidart, up Drynie Hill, and over to Acharacle. I visited the shop (hungry cyclist mode). Outside the shop an English accented man asked me about my bike. He was pretty impressed by the trip and told his two companions when they came out of the shop. They immediately gave me &pound;20 for MSF. Thanks! I'll have to add it to the <a href="http://justgiving.com/rtwbike">justgiving.com</a> site when it loads in my phone.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGTx75tVoAEqCdN?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Rain near Acharacle" /><figcaption>Rain near Acharacle</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I then visited the "Internet Cafe". They had WiFi in an area with little or no phone signal so became quite busy with tourists. I spent a bit too long sitting with a cup of tea so didn't leave until midday. I wasn't going to make the 13:15 ferry at Kilchoan.</p>
				
				<p>The road turned right to Kilchoan with the sea on my left for once. I've got really used to it being on the right so it was a bit odd. The road didn't reach any great height but was constantly up and down with blind corners on single track roads and tourist traffic. I hadn't realised that this was the way to "mainland Britain's most westerly point" as well as the island of Mull. That explains why it was so busy. Anyway, the tourists and the hills made it slower going.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped by the side of the road and had three fried egg sandwiches, a banana, a bar of chocolate, and some liquorice (from Norway). It was a hungry day.</p>
				
				<p>Eventually the road struck inland and up to skirt around the imposing Ben Hiant which was the flank of an ancient volcano that also formed Mull 60 million years ago. An information board told me that the basalts in Giant's Causeway were formed at the same time. This was around the time Europe and America started to drift apart more rapidly.</p>

				<p>After circling Ben Hiant I dropped down to Kilchoan. I could either get the 15:30 ferry or visit the most westerly point. Having been to the most northerly, and on my way to the most southerly, it seemed a shame to miss it. It was 10 km away over likely hilly, single track roads. It was after 3pm and the ferry was at 16:45. I'd be cutting things fine. I enquired about leaving my bags with the Kilchoan tourist information but they wouldn't let me. So up and over the hills I went, fully loaded. I was frustrated every time I had to stop for slow, inexperienced, tourist cars. I didn't have time for this. I reached the lighthouse at 15:44. I didn't have time to enjoy the moment, the glorious weather, or the sandy beach. After a quick photo I was back over all the hills I'd just tackled. I arrived at the ferry 15 minutes before departure as it requests in the timetable. I could relax.</p>

				<p>Over the sea took me to the many coloured buildings of Tobermory (the basis for the kids TV show Balamory). I visited the Coop and then a sailing store where I purchased 4m of thin rope as an experiment to keep my tent flap open as an awning. Then I rode up the steep hill to find the Tobermory campsite. Like every campsite I've stayed in in Scotland, it was &pound;8.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-08-02T21:46+0100 " datetime="2017-08-02T21:46+0100 ">Wednesday 02nd Aug 2017 (20:46 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I woke to a warm, still, tent. That meant it was sunny and the wind had died down. Drat. I could see the midges sat between the inner and outer waiting for me. I donned a full ETA (extra-tent-activity) suit consisting of full waterproofs,  neoprene gloves, mesh head covering, and cycle helmet. I got everything packed in the inner then girded myself. A quick exit and taking down the tent and I was off. A little way down the road I was able to remove it all as it was boiling hot in the glorious morning sunshine. </p>

				<p>I stopped at a recently opened community centre for tea and a breakfast bagel with scrambled egg. I had plenty of time because I knew I wouldn't make the mid-morning ferry. It was a lovely spot to sit and admire the mountains on the mainland. </p>

				<p>At Armadale there was quite a queue already. I bought my ticket for the price advertised in the ferry timetable. See Norway, it is possible. I had a brief chat with a fisherman, who hadn't caught anything as he'd got the tide times wrong, before pushing my bike onto the ferry. Up on deck a man from Huddersfield, spotting my Yorkshire Grand Depart top, askedif I was indeed from Yorkshire. I replied that I was and when we disembarked he gave me three quid to "get yourself a pint to keep pedalling".</p>

				<p>In Mallaig I found the Coop. Always dangerous. I bought plenty of food and then sat on a bench to eat some of it so that I didn't overload my bags. Food in me would soon burn off and I could dump packaging here in the bin.</p>
				
				<p>I bought a replacement Saltire to replace the one with the broken pole.</p>

				<p>It was late in the afternoon when I finally got going again. It has become a habit now to do lots of cycling in the evening. After 6pm the tourist traffic tends to reduce as the camper vans have started parking up for the night. It makes the narrow roads more bearable.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGTAgiHUQAAiDDT?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="looking out to sea" /><figcaption>looking out to sea</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>As I rode along though I did keep an eye out for a campsite. I'd done a couple of nights of wild camping and could do with a shower. Campsite after campsite was either "full" or only took caravans. I passed seven of then. On I rode. Over more hills and along more Lochs. Even the rare little parking sports where you could fit a tent, by the side of the Lochs, had camper vans in them.</p>

				<p>Eventually, along Loch Moidart, I found a little spot in the wind. Thank goodness for wind. It could be seen from the road in one direction but it was a quiet road so I decided not to care. It would be midge free. It wasn't far above the water and it wasn't high tide yet. However it was grassy so I decided that meant the tide didn't get this high. I was even able to find a stick to prop my tent flap open as a rain shelter. To sit with my tent doors open making dinner was so pleasant. Even with a bit of rain.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-08-01T22:19+0100 " datetime="2017-08-01T22:19+0100 ">Tuesday 01st Aug 2017 (21:19 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I donned my makeshift anti-midge gear and escaped my tent spot with a very poor packing of my tent. I rode the 7km to Applecross where there was a toilet. I packed my tent properly before the rain set in.</p>
				
				<p>In a cafe I had a vegetarian breakfast and tried to charge my phone. I was basically putting off the "big climb" I'd been warned about. The climb was up the Bealach Na Ba (way of the cattle) which someone had described as "Britain's toughest climb on a bike". In Applecross they told me this was the "easier" side to approach from. It would still be tough. So often drivers don't seem to be aware of how hilly a route is. This time even they were saying it would be a hard climb.</p>
				
				<p>I waited until near noon in the hope that people driving north along it would either plan to reach Applecross for lunch or do it in the mid afternoon. Even so there was still traffic and not all of it courteous. One big white Chelsea Tractor couldn't wait for my to reach a passing place and roared up past me very nearly clipping me.</p>
				
				<p>At 485m I caught up with a young girl who had been cycling up ahead of me. She was met by her family (Ian, Aisla, and Charlotte) who were encouraging her up the rest. Ian was kind enough to give me a tenner <a href="http://justgiving.com/RTWbike">for MSF</a>. Both of us set off again. I didn't know how far I had to go. A funny Australian, coming downhill in a 4x4, told me it was another 10 miles.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGJUNSeXsAAChfE?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Thanks to Ian and family" /><figcaption>Thanks to Ian and family</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>It turned out the summit was 625m above sea level (which is where Applecross is). That is higher than any summit I climbed in Norway. By quite some way. Will I ever get a break from the hills? At the summit I was welcomed by the family I'd met 140m lower. </p>

				<p>Then it was down the switchback turns 
				of the south side of the Bealach into 
				an amphitheatre of rock. This side 
				was certainly far more dramatic. I 
				was clutching my brakes hard most of 
				the way down. Before the bottom I 
				stopped for a late lunch. Out came 
				the frying pan. I'd earned three 
				eggs.</p>

				<p>Around a Loch and up over another hill took me to Lochcarron where I had a great piece of jaffa cake cheesecake. Double cake! Or is it half cake half biscuit? I still had a good way to go to the Kyle of Lochalsh and it was partly along single track roads with all the surprise hills. At 6pm, after a rain shower, I was bowling along a glistening woodland glade perched up on the side of the Loch with a railway line far below. </p>

				<p>At the Kyle of Lochalsh I found a Coop and bought a berry tart for six people. That would be pudding later. Then I was up the bridge and over the sea to Skye.</p>

				<p>On Skye I was hoping to find a campsite but the one I could find had a sign outside saying "totally full". Every B&B said "no vacancies" too. It looked like Skye was full. I made a decision not to cycle around it but just to ride to the ferry at Armadale. That wouldn't be tonight though as I'd missed the last ferry. I had to wild camp up amongst the bogs. A haven for midges but thankfully there was enough wind to keep them at bay. I passed the evening with the best phone/Internet signal I've had in Scotland even though I was surrounded by bog on Skye.</p>
