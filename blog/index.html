				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-07-01T15:00:00+CEDT" datetime="2015-07-01T15:00:00+CEDT">Wednesday 01st Jul 2015 (15:00 CEDT)</time></div>
				<p>In the morning I left the hostel and set off to find the Hagia Sofia. My first knowledge of it was as a wonder of the world in the computer game Civilization, and I'd been looking forward to finally seeing it in person.</p>
				
				<p>In the tourist area I had two Brits and then a nice lady from Melbourne ask me if I was from Yorkshire; it was written in big letters on my top. I took the opportunity to visit one of the tourist gift shops near the Blue Mosque to find a sticker for my bike. Through Serbia and Bulgaria it had been extremely difficult to find stickers but here I managed to find an entire sheet thanks to the shop keeper even if he was confused as to why I wanted to put them on my bike. As I was adding the stickers, the lady from Melbourne came back over to talk to me and then some Italians wanted their picture with me. I was becoming a tourist attraction in my own right.</p>

				<p>I pushed my bike over towards the Hagia Sofia. I wasn't in a rush. I'd originally set out to cross the US and had extended that to follow Stevens across Europe. I was finally here. I had cycled aross two continents and, as someone on Twitter pointed out, an entire religion. I had a content smile on my face. It has been fun following you Thomas. Enjoy the rest of your ride to Japan (in 1885-6). This is where my journey ends.</p>

				<p>Thanks to everyone who has followed me across two continents and for the many tweets of encouragement along the way. Thanks also to everyone who donated to Medicins Sans Frontiers.</p>

				<p>In Stevens' day he said the morning calls to prayer woke him at 5am. They seem to be at 3.30am for me. I had breakfast on the rooftop breakfast bar.</p>

				<p>A bit stuck. Back tracking.</p>
				
				<p>Had my own seven minutes of terror.</p>
				
				<p>A man in a white van stopped to say hello in Turkish. He wanted me to follow him. I think he is buying me a cola.</p>

				<p>Istanbul cycling can be quite stressful when the bike lanes stop. I've checked into a hostel and had a shower now so feel more relaxed.</p>

				<p>I had a haircut in &Ccedil;orlu. That feels much better. </p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19434698186"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3913/19434698186_f98e523715.jpg" alt="photo" title="Hairdresser (on the right)" /></a><figcaption>Hairdresser (on the right)</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>As I was leaving &Ccedil;orlu I popped into a petrol station to use the toilet. As I left a guy shouted "Bradley Wiggins" to me! Perhaps I need a shave.</p>
				
				<p>I know I can only average 6mph in big cities due to lights, traffic, navigation, stress stops. A capital takes the best part of a day. It would be quicker if I knew the streets and drivers but when you are new to them, more care is needed. That takes more time. The upshot is that I will give myself all day tomorrow to go the last 30 miles as lots of people have told me, Istanbul requires more care.</p>

				<p>The last proper shower I had was at the campsite in Bulgaria. Feeling that I'd like to stop smelling so badly, I checked in to a cheap hotel in Silivri mostly for the benefit of a shower. It is lovely here in Silivri.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19454476452"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/471/19454476452_3d649e713f.jpg" alt="photo" title="Silivri" /></a><figcaption>Silivri</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I was really glad to get off the D100 a few miles before Silivri as its hard shoulder was getting sketchy and the traffic was increasing. I really don't want to be on it the rest of the way into Istanbul.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19454500542"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/446/19454500542_51012836b4.jpg" alt="photo" title="Jupiter and Venus over Silivri" /></a><figcaption>Jupiter and Venus over Silivri</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At 6.22pm it is quite exciting to hear calls to prayer echoing out over the rooftops. As the evening progressed I had food at a local restaurant and was joined by an ex-journalist, now English teacher who was keen to practice his English skills. I walked around the lively harbour and admired Jupiter and Venus close together in the sky.</p>

				<p>Aside from briefly being woken by the musical call-to-prayer at 3.30am, I slept about 12 hours.</p>
				
				<p>200 km to go. Not sure if it is quiet due to Sunday or Ramadan.</p>

				<p>So far, in almost every shop I've been in the owner has followed me around. It is slightly disconcerting.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped at what looked like a little cafe with some men outside drinking tea (chai). I bought some then the men bought me a second. We shared almost no language. There were pantomimic gestures, a few words of German, and I learnt the word for flat in Turkish: d&uuml;z. Brill!</p>

				<p>I decided to cycle on ahead of Thomas Steven. I have better roads and want to make the most of the relative quiet today.</p>
				
				<p>I think the rain clouds are surrounding me.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19465002721"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/277/19465002721_ecddc32b67.jpg" alt="photo" title="Mosque" /></a><figcaption>Mosque</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Remembering some things that Tess and Francesca had told me in Serbia, I asked some guys working at a petrol station if there was camping nearby. I mentioned that I had cycled from Liverpool. They're Chelsea fans but said I could camp around the back of the petrol station! Behind the petrol station the ground was more suited for tent pegs than the real campsite I stayed in in Edirne! They also showed me the toilet. Such great hospitality.</p>

				<p>There is no shower here but then I didn't get much of a shower in Edirne because they ran out of water due to filling their pool.</p>
				
				<p>I finished the day a little short of &Ccedil;orlu. Tomorrow I'm going to head for Silivri.</p>
