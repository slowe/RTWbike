				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-02T10:40:00+PDT" datetime="2015-05-02T10:40:00+PDT">Saturday 02nd May 2015 (10:40 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>After having completed the US leg of Thomas Stevens' journey, I am about to embark on the second. This will follow his route from Liverpool, England to Istanbul, Turkey. He had arrived in Liverpool on April 19 by ship from New York. He set off from Edge Hill church at 4pm on Saturday May 2nd. That is today. My dad is about to give me a lift over to Liverpool. I will try to update my blog more this time but otherwise I will <a href="https://twitter.com/rtwbike">still be on Twitter</a>.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0053.html">Over the Rockies</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-31T20:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-31T20:00:00+PDT">Saturday 31st May 2014 (20:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>On the Friday there was a threat of rain and as it followed through on that threat I decided to go back to the cafe to continue uploading photos. I ended up spending most of the day there enjoying their shakes and sandwiches. By 5.30 pm the rain stopped and I left the cafe to go back to the KOA. At least the wind had stopped.</p>
				
				<p>It rained through the night but the dawn was blue sky and sunshine. This was the right day to cross the Rockies. After a trip to the laundry to dry off some clothes, and a pause for the sun to dry my tent, I went back into town and got another of the delicious high calorie shake at the cafe. Fuelled up I crossed town and joined the I-80 at the last frontage road. </p>
				
				<p>On the ride into Laramie I'd been wondering where the Rockies were. Why couldn't I see them? All I could see were some small hills. As I left Laramie I realised I'd been slowly climbing across Wyoming and was at 7400 ft above sea level. The highest point of the Rockies on my route was only 1300 ft higher. The little hills I'd seen were the Rockies. I should note that elsewhere the Rockies are much taller and dramatic - I was crossing at a fairly easy point for good reason!</p>
				
				<p>The interstate wound around between the hills. From the plains you'd be forgiven for thinking it must go into a tunnel but it winds upwards over the summit. By "summit" I refer to the highest point on the Lincoln Highway at 8620 ft but it was slightly lower than the original Lincoln Highway. The modern railroad goes a different route. The summit is overlooked by a giant head of Abraham Lincoln made to celebrate the anniversary.</p>

				<p>In the visitor centre <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/472798180405686272">I felt I'd earned</a> the free "bike Wyoming" sticker given that I'd cycled from the west side of the state all the way to this point nearly at the eastern extreme. The lady at the desk said that if I was heading to Cheyanne I should really go via the nicer WY210 - <em>Happy Jack Road</em>. That put me in a quandry. Do I stick to my planned route (which wasn't exactly the same as Stevens anyway) or go this other road. I <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/472801394442133504">put it to the public vote</a>. By the end of my lunch break Anne Akers, Chris North and my sister had all opted for Happy Jack Road so I went that way.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-29T20:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-29T20:00:00+PDT">Thursday 29th May 2014 (20:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I went into Laramie to have a look around. I found the historic part of downtown and started looking for a bike shop. On Front Street I found <a href="http://www.pedalhouse.com/">The Pedal House</a> which was recommended to me by Rick back in Rock Springs. It had a large mural of a man with a penny farthing on the wall outside. I went in and got talking to the man at the front desk. They'd actually heard of Thomas Stevens and the guy showed me pictures of the Laramie Bicycle Club from around that time. He said they were big geeks about this stuff.</p>

				<p>I entrusted my bike to them so they could fix the broken spoke and headed off to get lunch at a vegetarian place - Sweet Melissa - they had recommended a few doors down. I got a large black bean and sweet potato burrito with side salad and root beer. It was so nice to have proper vegetables for the first time since Utah.</p>
				
				<p>Laramie was a lively, studenty, college town. It felt very relaxed and a little bit cool. After a drink at a local coffee shop I headed back to The Pedal House where the mechanics then took a look at my bike. They spotted my handlebars were a bit loose so fixed that. They then let me wash my bike out the back and even fitted a replacement, second-hand, kickstand for me. Local bike shops are brilliant!</p>

				<p>I then headed to Iveson House home of the Laramie Plains Museum. There I arrived just after a tour had started and the lady in the ticket office - the wonderfully named Mary Mountain - ushered me around to join it. She told me I'd be joining another Englishman from London. Inside I was greeted by the Docent, Kim, who was the tour guide. The other tourist was from UCL her on a mathematics conference. Kim told us about the Ivesn family history and the history of the house. It has been beautifully restored using local materials and fixtures from the time. Apparently Mr Iveson married in his 90s and his septagenarian wife took many of the fixtures and fittings to her own house when they divorced soon after. He'd then married a 13 year old who he met on a boat! His banks made lots of money and it showed in the house. In his later years he started giving back to the local community and set up an orphanage, and old ladies home and a hospital. On the third floor (second if you aren't American) there was a penny farthing and a picture of Thomas Stevens!</p>

				<p>Kim set his two tourees a quiz to name the state motto. I had actually been asking people that exact question all through the state and had got a variety of answers. It turned out Vivian from Granger Town Hall was correct; it was "The Equality State" as it was the first government to let women vote in all elections. Kim turned out to be a cyclist himself so I promised a postcard. Mary and RJ in the ticket office/shop got talking to me afterwards.</p>

				<p>I cycled down the street to the university then back to the main street to find an internet cafe with a computer to upload some photos. They made very nice smoothies.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-28T19:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-28T19:00:00+PDT">Wednesday 28th May 2014 (19:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>This morning I visited the <em>Medicine Bow</em> museum which was being looked after by a man who was very hard of hearing.</p>
				
				<p>I tried to wash my bike at the gas station but only removed some of the mud/clay. The going today would have been fine apart from the same fierce head wind from the day before. I could hardly keep up 8 mph despite putting in a lot of effort. Just before <em>Rock River</em> (not to be confused with <em>Rock Springs</em> or <em>Green River</em> where I'd been a few days before) I spotted some solar panels and a camera on a pole. A quick check online showed me that <a href="http://wyoroad.info/highway/webcameras/US30RockRiver/US30RockRiver.html">this was indeed a webcam</a>. I quickly texted and tweeted people back home and told them I'd only wait for 20 minutes as it was too hot to hang around. I'm glad to say that my soon to be nephew-in-law, Dan FM and <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislintott/status/471730038136897536">Chris Lintott managed to grab</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/exoplaneteer/status/471737072521592832/photo/1">screenshots of me</a> to prove I'd been there.</p>

				<p>In Rock River I stopped to get a drink and sweets in the General Store. It turned out that the clerk's son had cycled coast-to-coast in 3 parts. The remaining 37 miles were a slog in the strong wind and blazing heat. I was glad to be approaching Laramie when I spotted a tourer going the other way. We chatted across the road and it turned out he'd set off from the west coast. He had been scared off by the tornadoes in the mid west last week and so was returning back to the west coast!</p>

				<p>Laramie has a population of around 30,000 and was a sight for tired eyes. I checked my tent into the KOA.</p>
				
				<p>Total distance cycled so far: 1489 miles.</p>
