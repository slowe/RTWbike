				<p>The rash has been slowly going down. So I'm back on the road after a very long sleep last night.</p>
				
				<p>Today sees me visit the northernmost point in Spain but also has a sapping number of hills.</p>

				<p>I looked north across the Bay of Biscay. Over there was Ireland and Mizen Head where I was just a month ago.</p>
				
				<p>As I got back to the car park I heard someone say "there's a Yorkshire tshirt". I met Ian and Jean. Jean is from Sheffield. It turns out they had first met in Burley-in-Wharfdale. It is a small world. We had a nice chat. They have been trying to spot Spanish bears. That worried me but Ian insisted they are very rare and shy.</p>

				<p>As I stopped to consult a map in Cedeira, a black cat crossed my path and looked expectantly at me. I think it thought I was its human as a man turned up on a bicycle and, realising its error, ran over to him.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DK_KzzKXkAAW-Ip.jpg" alt="landscape" title="Finally the air felt fresher as I rounded the top of Spain." /><figcaption>Finally the air felt fresher as I rounded the top of Spain.</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>At this point my breathing suddenly felt easier. My cold symptoms were still there but my ungs felt better. I started to wonder if it was hayfever from some plant in this region. Now that I was rounding the coast the prevailing winds would be bringing me ocean air rather than air from the land. Fingers crossed that that was the source of the cold.</p>
				
				<p>I had been heading for a campsite on the coast but realised that would be another 179m hill (which I'd have to climb back over tomorrow) and I felt I should try to reduce the number of kilometres I had planned for tomorrow. So I headed on to Ferrol. The next campsite was going to be 2 hours cycle further which would make it near sunset. So, I chickened out and treated myself to a hotel. It turned out that paying in person it was cheaper than on the popular booking websites. Either that or the &pound; is having issues.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017109.html">EHIC to the rescue</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-09-29T23:59+0200" datetime="2017-09-29T23:59+0200">Friday 29th Sep 2017 (21:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I have a head cold and an itchy rash on my feet, legs, and arms. :(</p>
				
				<p>I probably need to find a public health centre (EHIC) but can't navigate <a href="https://t.co/eUXIwharQx"></a> I'm in Viveiro.</p>
				
				<p>I took an antihistamine last night but it hasn't helped.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DK4B-x-WsAAfchh.jpg" alt="landscape" title="Rash" /><figcaption>Rash</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I'm hoping it is hives from the exertion of the past three days.</p>
				
				<p>I visited the local public health centre. Quite understandably, nobody really spoke English (or French). Google translate was our friend.</p>
				
				<p>I'm glad I had my EHIC card with me. The only confusion was my US travel visa as it looks like a photo page so they thought I was American.</p>
				
				<p>But we managed to clear that up and get to the right page in my passport showing I was from the EU.</p>
				
				<p>I joined a queue to see a doctor. I only had to wait 10 minutes. She prescribed an injection and some antihistamines for the next 5 days.</p>
				
				<p>I then went downstairs where I was given two injections in my buttocks. It was Urbason. The second was quite painful and I got lightheaded</p>
				
				<p>The second doctor checked my blood pressure and I had a rest for a few minutes. She told me to take some juice or coffee with sugar.</p>
				
				<p>It is quite scary getting treatment when you can't really communicate because you don't know the language and people don't know yours.</p>
				
				<p>But credit to the Spanish health service for seeing to me quickly, professionally, and kindly. You realise how lucky we are in Europe.</p>
				
				<p>My EHIC card means the only cost to me was Euro 4.40 for the prescription. They also told me to rest as the pills would make me drowsy.</p>
				
				<p>So I checked into a cheap hotel. I'm going to eat and rest. Hopefully the rash will go down.</p>
				
				<p>All this is a reminder of the important care the folks at @MSF_uk provide to those in much harder situations <a href="https://t.co/KohIMIW8v3"></a></p>
