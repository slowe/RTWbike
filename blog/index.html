				<p>At breakfast I had an interesting conversation with Ashley from 
				Tennessee about cultural differences and similarities. With a late start 
				I headed out of Munich only stopping to buy some cheese and German bread 
				in the market. This morning was threatening rain and I was heading 
				towards black clouds. Thankfully they seemed to be going in the same 
				direction. Out of the suburbs I had bike tracks through forest. They 
				were well signed for local towns and these ones were even better by 
				listing bigger places as much as 28km away. That is much more useful for 
				the long distance cyclist. The riding was pleasant and my knees were 
				able to cope with the gentle hills. For five minutes I had a little rain 
				shower but after that I was able to put my waterproofs away. </p>
				
				<p>By 3pm I 
				had reached Haag and I rewarded myself with an icecream. I hit the 
				pleasant Inn valley and was surprised how big the Inn river was. </p>
				
				<p>Following the Inn Trail I caught up with Michel and Connie - a German 
				couple spending three days on the Inn trail - so accompanied them to 
				Mulhdorf where I saw the covered arcades mentioned by Stevens. Here I 
				said goodbye and joined the trail again as I had another 10 miles to 
				Altoetting. About half way there I took my phone out for a picture and 
				found the screen had mysteriously cracked. Disaster! It would no longer 
				respond. I was stranded without communication.</p>
				
				<p>Arriving in Altoetting I pushed past the closed shops selling crucifixes and assorted paraphernalia.</p>

				<p>I'd been writing blogvposts about the days after Paris on my 
				phone and had't got around to posting them. Unfortunately, 
				as you'll read next, my phone screen broke and now I can't 
				access them. Hopefully I can get them back once I return 
				home to the UK. For now, we'll have to skip on to Munich.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-140T21:42:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-140T21:42:00+0200">Wednesday 13th May 2015 (22:42 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It rained through the night so in the morning I did my best to dry my tent. Clotilde lent me their foot pump to get my tyres back to pressure. Once they were packed up they set off on their impressive tandem and trailer. I left a couple of minutes behind them. By 10.30 I was in Mantes-la-jolie and once again decided to over-rule my GPS and go the quieter roads. These proved hilly but pleasant and helped by the courteous drivers. In Maule I happened to glimpse Clotilde and Pierre in a bus shelter. I stopped and joined them for lunch. They had just boiled up some minestrone. It was so nice to meet them again. After lunch our paths really did diverge as I headed fort Saint Germain and they went more south.</p>

				<p>On the outskirts of Saint Germain I stopped at a shopping centre for free WiFi and to buy a plug adapter (needlessly it would turn out because I had my worldwide one with me and had forgotten about it). It was at this point that the long threatened rain finally came. Thankfully I was under shelter.</p>
				
				<p>After the deluge had abated I set off again through the charming Saint Germain end Laye. Over the river again I ignored my Gps's claim of 45 miles and went along a pleasant riverside bike path. It eventually turned into quiet, one-way Road. I was going the wrong way but the signs said "sauf velos" so I was OK. It explained why my GPS wasn't happy. Back over the bridge I was hoping to get into Paris before the rush hour. I may have been helped by a public holiday as it was fairly quiet and much easier riding than London.</p>
				
				<p>I reached Port Maillot and then another mile to the Arc de Triomphe for an obligatory photo opportunity. Here I got a crepe with Nutella for two-thirds the price of one on Brighton pier.</p>
