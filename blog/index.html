				<p>I met the Dutch couple again at breakfast. Their names were Petra and Anne. They told me my lunch stop yesterday was near to a secret thing for cyclists. I'm not sure what the thing was but they were going to seek it out.</p>

				<p>I was off around 10.15 with shoes that were still disappointingly wet after yesterday despite me putting them in the drying room. My dorm mate from Corsica said he'd look out for me on the road whilst he was driving. I made good progress despite the westerly wind against me. Going around a big bay I met a group of Norwegian cyclists. They were cycling Lofoten.</p>

				<p>Near Lyngv&aelig;r I saw a sea eagle high overhead. Unfortunately it wasn't for getting any lower preferring to view things from afar. My route thankfully took me off the E10 Road onto the 815 which was quieter and on the eastern side of the island so was sheltered from the wind.</p>

				<p>I made it to Leknes just after 2pm after a surprise 110m hill. The cafes were too expensive (standard Norwegian prices) so I went to the Coop and made my own lunch out of town sheltering from the wind in a bus stop. I rode on over a pass down into the westerly wind and around a big fjord to Ramberg. The fjord had lovely sandy beaches but the weather wasn't really suitable to enjoy them. It looked as though the wind was bringing in some better weather. </p>

				<p>I caught up briefly with Victoria and Ewan from a few days ago. They'd seen Sheena and Alistair yesterday too. Shortly afterwards I caught up with Aris and Florence from Greece. They'd cycled from Nordkapp and were heading for the same ferry. Aris had built his own bike so it was "38% longer than most".</p>

				<p>Cycling on to Moskenes I passed drying cod's heads, beautiful mountains and pretty little sea side villages.</p>

				<p>I had to carry on past Moskenes another 4.5km to &Aring; (pronounced like the a in saw). It marks the end of the road in Lofoten. A friendly group of Norwegian motorcyclists took my photo for me.</p>

				<p>I had taken my time today as the plan was to get the 23.45 ferry. That way I don't have to stay anywhere tonight and can be bright and early for a visit to the bike shop in the morning. As I sailed away from Lofoten it gave me one parting gift; a dramatic view of the midnight sun.</p>

				<p>I didn't sleep well on the lumpy ground. I woke to rain at 6.30 and went back to sleep. At 9.30 it was still spitting but I packed up my tent anyway. At least the rain kept the flies at bay. I only had a banana for breakfast as I was lacking water (yes, I know it was falling from the sky) and didn't fancy cooking in the wet.</p>

				<p>I headed to the ferry at Melbu. I didn't even know if it'd be running on a Sunday. I happened to get there perfectly as they'd started boarding. It was only 25 minutes across to Fiskeb&oslash;l but it was raining so I stayed inside.</p>
				
				<p>I was tired today. I nearly fell asleep on my bicycle. I got my feet wet filling my water bottles in a mountain stream. I decided to stop for lunch. Finding a sheltered spot is hard though. Eventually I found a small bus shelter and used that. I'm not sure what I'd have done if a bus stopped.</p>

				<p>I pressed on towards Svolv&aelig;r. That would make 83 km (including the ferry ride). But first it was over a hill. A hill of only 45m but my gears are getting really stiff and changing down is getting hard. Over that I reached Austnesfjorden where there was a view point. The light rain had eased off and I dodged around the Italian tourists to get a picture whilst also taking one for them.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDv9tCjWsAAspT5?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Austnesfjorden" /><figcaption>Austnesfjorden</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>On to Svolv&aelig;r I headed. Getting there around 5pm. All the big supermarkets were closed as it was Sunday. Eventually I found a Kiwi Mini Prix that was open. It was just the basics and was full of foreign tourists like me desperate for any shop.</p>
				
				<p>I was going to do another 30 km to get the miles in, so to speak, but I saw a sign for a youth hostel. Dilemma. It was more than my budget but I have been in a tent for 16 nights. Oh for a proper bed. I found I could pay with my UK card and that they had "free tea and cake" so I was sold. I ate a lot of their cake.</p>
				
				<p>I met a retired Dutch couple who had cycled from Bergen. They were able to tell me that it was 1522 km from Bergen to Bod&oslash;. I have 18 days for that (130 km tomorrow). That's 80km/day average. I can reach my flight.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017019.html">Land of the flies </a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-07-01T20:30+0100 " datetime="2017-07-01T20:30+0100 ">Saturday 01st Jul 2017 (19:30 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I woke late. Sheena brought out some maps and we discussed routes and ferries. I packed up and said goodbye to my friends on the road and continued south.</p>
				
				<p>The weather was on the change. The beautiful sunshine of yesterday had given way to clouds that threatened rain. I cycled over the bridge at Risk&oslash;yhamn. I cycled around the inlet at Buksnasfjord and then had lunch on the beach on the Risk&oslash;ysundet channel where I think I saw a seal pop its head out of the water. This was one of the few spots I found were I could stop without being mobbed by flies.</p>

				<p>Getting anywhere in Norway involves more kilometres than it looks on a map thanks to the fractal coastline. I had another big fjord to go around at Forfjord.</p>

				<p>Eventually I got to and over the bridge to Sortland. Despite a rather pretty church, the centre of Sortland felt drab. It was 4pm on a Saturday and nearly all the shops were shut. The tourist information office had closed at 2pm. I'd been going to ask them about ferries to Bod&oslash;. At least the Coop was open.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="portrait"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDq72BDXYAE_8Ah?format=jpg" alt="portrait" title="Sortland church" /><figcaption>Sortland church</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>South of Sortland was more pleasant. There was a separate cycle/walking path which was flatter than the main road. I politely interrupted a Norwegian lady hanging out some washing to ask if she could fill my water bottles. I reached the bottom of Lang&oslash;ya and was up and over the 3km long, 35m high bridge to Stokmarknes. The bridges are so high so shipping can get through the channels.</p>
				
				<p>At Stokmarknes I had a choice of which side of the island to go around. I chose the west side as the map showed a swimmer symbol and that suggested a likely camping spot with a toilet. Unfortunately, as it turned out, I couldn't find a toilet. There was a nice view but as soon as I started putting up my tent the mob of flies were back. I got out my travel head net which solved the fly issue but made eating dinner a bit more of a challenge. </p>

				<p>I went to sleep on rather bumpy ground.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-30T01:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-30T01:00+0100">Friday 30th Jun 2017 (00:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>In the morning I woke feeling warm. A little too warm. All the layers I've grown accustomed to wearing were unnecessary in strong sunlight. I had another dip in the Atlantic. I took my time having lots for breakfast.  I didn't want to leave this perfect slice of summer.</p>
				
				<p>I finally got on the way at 11am aware that I should aim for the 3pm ferry at Gryllefjord. The route went in and out of more bays then went up. Not more up my knees complained. Actually they were complaining a little less. Perhaps Christophe's oils have helped. Or perhaps it was just the sun.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="full"><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDkioG2XkAAHOrt?format=jpg"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDkioG2XkAAHOrt?format=jpg" alt="panorama" title="Senja" /></a><figcaption>Senja</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>About 100 metres up there was a viewing platform. There were also several cyclists. Here I met Kristen and her dog Whisky from the UK. She was heading north. I also met Jonathan from Germany heading north. Then Agata from Poland arrived from the same direction as me. She was followed by Victoria and Ewan from Scotland/Finland. It was getting like Piccadilly Circus on the side of this mountain. Kristen warned of the tunnel ahead. We'd be going up for 1.9km inside it.</p>

				<p>I got going. At the start of the tunnel I got behind Victoria and Ewan as I felt we'd be safer in a more visible group. It wasn't that bad in the end and was shorter than the Nordkapp tunnel.</p>

				<p>Down the other side I let Victoria and Ewan go on ahead whilst I took photos. I reached a lovely bay with glorious blue water and some sandy beaches. This is the Arctic I kept reminding myself.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="portrait"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDk9jYjXgAM-YIN?format=jpg" alt="portrait" title="Flowers" /><figcaption>Flowers</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I had to get a move on to catch that ferry otherwise I'd have a four hour wait for the next. Around the next corner my heat fell. I could see a road contouring up a big hill. As I got closer I saw there was also a tunnel. Which would it be? Thankfully the answer was the tunnel. It was new. It went downwards. It was well lit. Hooray. I sailed into Gryllefjord with 15 minutes to spare. At the ferry, as well as Victoria and Ewan, I met Robert and Martin who had both cycled from Germany. The coast of Norway is a popular route, clearly. </p>

				<p>The ferry took about 2 hours to get to Andenes. There I went to the Tourist information office and used to WiFi. As I headed out of town I reached a cross roads and was wondering why a camper van was driving so slowly across it. Then I spotted Alistair driving it. Sheena and Alistair were here! As it happens they'd got talking to Victoria and Ewan in a shop due to their Irn Bru tops and they said I was behind them. It was so nice to see Sheena and Alistair again.</p>

				<p>They were going to park in a swimming spot a few kilometres north of N&oslash;ss. It was 40km away. I didn't fancy 40km of hills. However, cycling along to Bleik I realised And&oslah;ya was different to what I've experienced so far. It was pretty flat. The wind was actually behind me. The sun was out. I forgave a suggested camping spot near Bleik and made the most of the favourable conditions. I sustained over 30km/h for a while.</p>

				<p>I reached the camping spot just after 8pm. Sheena and Alistair kindly let me eat in their van and Alistair opened a bottle of wine. We chatted long into the evening sharing stories. The midnight sun is a tricky thing. We hadn't realised the time. It was well after 1am but it had been an evening well spent. I went to bed under blue skies, happy.</p>
