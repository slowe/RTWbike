				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-04T21:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-04T21:00:00+0200">Thursday 04th Jun 2015 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Last night I finally had an interactive room mate in the dorm. He was Donny from Wisconsin touring Europe. He seemed a bit fed up that the girls staying at the hostel were all in school groups and too young for him.</p>
				
				<p>I left the hostel at 8.30 and it was suspiciously quiet. There was virtually no traffic on the streets. It was only when I found that the supermarket was closed that I realised that Stevens had warned me about this; it was Corpus Christi. I'd been banking on getting supplies for the day at the supermarket so now I had nowhere to get food or drink from. Eventually, on the way out of Vienna, I tracked down a water fountain and filled up my bottles.</p>
				
				<p>Unfortunately the EV6 mostly takes the north bank of the river at this point but I had to go to Schwechat to follow Stevens. The roads weren't too bad - probably helped by the fact it was a holiday. That is the second capital city I've been lucky enough to be cycling in on a holiday. </p>
				
				<p>When travelling through so many countries it is interesting to see how things change. One little change I noticed was the style of the people on the pedestrian/bicycle signs. They had been consistently blue through Europe but the little silhouettes varied. In Austria the adult had gained a little hat and the child a dress.</p>

				<p>My "radroute" took me <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606379599061237760">through the airport</a> making it the fifth international airport that I've cycled to, from or through; the others being Heathrow (to), San Francisco (from), Boston (to), and Gatwick (through). I was then passing on a mixture of roads and cycle lanes (EV6 again) through farmland and by wind farms.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19452707715"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/19452707715_63bbbb2616_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Farms - land and wind" /></a><figcaption>Farms - land and wind</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>After passing one particularly large wind farm I found the Heidentor - an ancient Roman gate - just before Petronelle-Carnuntum. Nobody was quite sure why it had been built but part of it remains. It also had signs in the ground pointing to various important cities in the Roman world. I was happy to find my first sign to Constantinopolis (Istanbul). Onwards!</p>

				<p>I rode through quiet little villages filling my bottle up at water fountains. As the path got closer to the Danube I started to be joined by a few families out for a ride on the holiday. At Hainburg I found the 900 year old archway that Stevens described. There were no rows of Hungarian soliders lining the streets this Corpus Christie though. That tradition seems to be long gone. At the other side of Hainburg old town I found another archway. That left me wondering if I'd be admiring the wrong one before. I took a picture with this one too just to be safe.</p>

				<p>Up a slight rise gave a view across a plain to the unmistakable sight of Bratislava in the distance. Bratislava is in Slovakia and I knew I'd have to cross a border. I didn't know what currency was used either. As it turns out the old border post is deserted and the bike path just carries on into Slovakia and under the motorway bridge that crosses the Danube. There were now lots of people out on bikes enjoying the sunshine.</p>

				<p>Across the river I noted that the pedestrian on the pedestrian sign had obtained a more jaunty hat and the child a bow in their hair. I stopped for lunch and cake and was glad to find they took Euros. After that I went up the hill to the castle for a brief visit. I didn't go inside as I was trying to make my budget stretch and I even avoided the toilets when I found they were 1 Euro.</p>

				<p>Back across the Danube underneath another road bridge took me back to the EV6 which was slightly re-routed along a footpath at one point due to building work. It is suprising how badly re-routed it can be considering it is a major international cycle route. I wonder if the people who do the re-routing know that. Perhaps they don't care. Aside from this, the cycle track (shared with pedestrians) was excellent and ran for miles. It made for very pleasant riding. </p>
				
				<p>My GPS was having trouble routing me on this bit mostly because I was near a national border and the way I've compiled OpenStreetMap seems to have trouble at borders. That didn't matter though because the way was obvious. I crossed the border into Hungary but only knew that because of my map.</p>
				
				<p>The first village I encountered - Rajka - had tourist signs in multiple languages. <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606505327811555330">It turns out</a> that in Roman times they had "limes protecting the empire"; I love a comedy mistranslation.</p>
				
				<p>With a separate bike lane I was bowling along at a good pace but also able to admire the countryside. The thing that struck me was how colourful the fields were. Reds, blues, <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606774340319903744">purples</a>, greens and yellows.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/18122866203"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/418/18122866203_361f84d816_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Purple fields" /></a><figcaption>Purple fields</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>!<a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/351/18120897174_3f4158712e_z_d.jpg">landscape</a></p>
				
				<p>Just before 5 o'clock I reached the little village of Bezenye and took a picture of the church as the bells rang out. A little old lady who lived opposite the church saw me, smiled and waved. I smiled back and tried to say something to her but either she was hard of hearing or didn't understand English so just sort of nodded at me smiling. I waved and carried on. At Mosonmagyar&ograve;v&agrave;r I managed to find a camping pitch at the Thermal Hotel Aqua. The campsite area was mostly motorhomes and, like the RVs of America, their occupants didn't seem interested in talking to cyclists with tents.</p>
				
				<p>When I checked in the lady at the desk didn't really have enough English but seemed to tell me I had to come back for the spa at 8pm. I assumed they must have some kind of allotted times and mine was later as I'd arrived late in the day. At 7.55pm I duly turned up only to discover that it closed at 8pm. She'd been trying to tell me that but had only managed to communicate the importance of 8pm. Seeing that I'd lost out, a man who'd been sitting out at the front looking through paperwork came over to help me. He was some kind of cross between a manager, a bouncer and a janitor. Whatever his role, he seemed kind and beckoned for me to follow him. It turned out I could use the small swimming pool/spa until 10pm so I was able to relax in their thermal waters after all. It meant I got a bath and a shower!</p>

				<p>The youth hostel I was staying at was on the large 'island' created by a split in the Danube. It was actually a few miles from most of the main tourist sites and seemed largely to be be visited by large school groups. As I sat on the floor in the reception area - the only place the wifi was available - an angry looking man came through the door. He gave me an evil looking stare as he went by. The hostel was huge so I reasoned that the chances of him being in the same room as me were small. A little later when I got back to the room I was pleased to find it empty. However, a few minutes later, he turned up. He was my room mate and he'd had a bit to drink. It turned out he'd missed his last train or bus home from Vienna. Thankfully he wasn't a beligerant drunk but he still made me nervous. I kept my important possessions (money, passport, phone) very close throughout the night. In the morning he left and I stayed in bed for a while.</p>

				<p>I was in a major capital city full of sights but I really needed to do some laundry. The hostel, despite its size, didn't have any laundry facilities. They told me of a laundrette two miles away. Thankfully I had a bike so that wasn't a worry for me. <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/605364839469461505">I did my washing</a>. It is nice to have fresh smelling clothes. I also visited the supermarket. I was really living it up in Vienna.</p>
				
				<p>On Tuesday, I decided to visit the Vienna Wanderers' Bicycle Club as Stevens had done. The problem is that they don't exist any more and neither does the street they were on; Schwimmschulenstrasse. <a href="https://twitter.com/Reesiepie/status/605425446864461825">Marie O'Sullivan on Twitter</a> managed to find out that it was near the station (<a href="http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=116717&imageview=true">grid reference F3 in an old map of Vienna</a>) only Schwimmschulenstrasse between 1873-1919. It was now Lassallestrasse. Even though the bicycle club didn't exist, I visited anyway and rode the length of the street. Afterwards I stumbled across an impromptu solar system scale model in the street near the station that was organised by the Zeiss Planetarium Wien. I then wandered over to the big wheel and had a ride through the large park. I then cycled over to the main part of the city and whiled away the afternoon snoozing in the pleasant Rathausplatz park near the Rathaus (town hall).</p>

				<p>Wednesday was my last full day in Vienna so I went to the MuseumsQuartier to visit _mumok_ - the museum of modern art. It had everything from David Hockney (<a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606073606028853249">pleased to see him labelled as "Bradford, Yorkshire"</a>) to Yoko Ono to videos of naked bodies having paint thrown at them. Outside the MuseumsQuartier was a <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606152094505177089">vegan festival</a> and I had a very nice vegan curry with lassi. As I left the festival I saw a young woman on a zebra-stripe bike adorned with roses. She told me it was some kind of pun as the German words for zebra and bike are similar.</p>

				<p>Packing up my tent I had to deal with ants crawling over all my stuff again. I wish we could come to a peace negotiation.</p>
				
				<p>I headed off along the pleasant <a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-6/countries/austria">EV6</a> into an impressive valley cut by the mighty river Danube. The EV6 goes along both banks at this point but I stuck to the south side reasoning that it would provide more shade for me and better lighting of the north for photographs. It was very pleasant and I stopped for breakfast at a little cafe where I was the only customer early on a Sunday morning. </p>

				<p>Enjoyable miles took me to Ybbs where there were lots of signs along the trail advertising a bicycle museum. Unfortunately for me, and the other cyclists who'd had their interest piqued, it was shut on a Sunday. If only I'd been a day earlier like Stevens.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19264993908"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/292/19264993908_483e4d4b5d_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Sign to the bicycle museum" /></a><figcaption>Sign to the bicycle museum</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>Onwards to Melk and the impressive monastery Stevens had mentioned. It certainly was big and still dominates the town. As I approached, I had to deal with clueless tourists pouring out of a Viking River Cruise boat into the cycle path. Then I got surrounded by a similarly unaware group of perhaps 20 touring cyclists all wearing matching green Lycra. In trying to get away from them I nearly came off my bike. In Melk I enquired at the tourist information about the oldest barbers to see if I could find where <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/000162.shtml">Thomas had a shave</a>. The lady in the tourist information office was confused by my request and told me they would be shut because it was Sunday. I said it didn't matter. I think she preferred the sort of questions from the cruise ship tourists.</p>

				<p>After a nice ice cream and a look around, with a heavy heart I left the flat and pretty EV6 to head across country. Unlike the previous diversions 'in-land' though this didn't look as hilly. That was true in parts. The cycle routes tended to follow the non-hypotenuse sides of triangles with the motorway taking the direct route. </p>

				<p>I reached Neulengbach where Thomas had stayed on the Saturday night. It didn't look to have much in the way of accommodation and a call to a youth hostel in Vienna indicated their reception was open 24 hours. I decided I'd press on and catch up. The only drawback was that Google Maps showed a huge hill. A well placed petrol station supplied me with juice as I'd exhausted all my liquid reserves. The hill was big but the downhill was glorious and long. It lasted about 15 miles to Vienna - several miles of which I stayed on the tail of a guy on a road bike much to his surprise and amusement.</p>
				
				<p>As I got into the city I found a river-side bike path for a few miles. In the city, lots of people were on bikes and there were plenty of bike lanes. I got freaked out by polite motorists giving way when bike lanes crossed roads. UK drivers wouldn't dream of doing that; at least not universally enough to trust that they would. The youth hostel was all the way across the city so it was getting dark as I arrived. I'd broken the Imperial century (100 miles), was exhausted, famished, but had at least caught up with Thomas. And he was giving me a few days off to recover!</p>

				<p>I took full advantage of loading up my stomach at breakfast and got an earlyish start. The temperatures were getting hotter and it was blue skies. I was going to melt.</p>

				<p>On the way out of Wels <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/604553102621044736">I randomly discovered Jupiter</a> which meant I was on another planet path. There was lots of nice bike trail that thankfully became wooded giving me some shade. Unfortunately the trail ended near Traun and my GPS decided the bike trails cut the corner off the bend of the river. Of course that meant hills. These weren't too bad and I even had some forest cover at some point. Down the other side to the Danube and I reunited with the Eurovelo 6. I decided to have a rest and a banana at one nice spot with a good view along the river. There was a bench but it was occupied by two other touring cyclists. I must have looked longingly at it because the lady asked if I wanted to sit down. She asked in English! The couple turned out to be Jane and John from Swansea who were cycling to Vienna along the Danube. They'd been in Blaubeuren and Ulm but had sensibly stuck with the river rather than strike a direct line over the hills as Stevens had. It was really nice to have a conversation and I ended up cycling with them to Wallsee. </p>

				<p>Unfortunately that meant I'd gone 3 miles beyond Strengberg so I had to head backwards. There followed a bit of cursing of Stevens as I realised Strengberg was up a big hill. Seriously Thomas, why not stay in the flat of the Danube valley?</p>

				<p>The town was closed. Even the shop only did half day trading on a Saturday so it was back down the hill (couldn't get the full benefits due to a blind bend) and back up the other side to Well see. I decided to press on back to the EV6. Reaching Ardagger I saw one of the motorhome parks that they had in France - basically a bit of ground provided by the village with some electrical hook up points and a toilet block. This one had some grass though so being braver I asked a motorhomer if I could camp. They said "why not? give it a go" so I did. I boiled up some water and made tea and minestrone as the church bells rang out. The Morrison's Cafe milk sachets I've been carrying proved useful.</p>
