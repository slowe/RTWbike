				<h2 class="title"><a href="0024.html">The infamous Winnemucca</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-03T22:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-03T22:00:00+PDT">Saturday 03rd May 2014 (22:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I woke, let my tent dry from the overnight condensation and headed off to the I-80. Unless there were obvious frontage roads, I was going to use the I-80 to Winnemucca. People back home had warned me about the massive trucks but I found the cross-country truckers in America to be very pleasant and courteous. Where they could they'd leave an entire lane of space as well as my comfortably big hard shoulder. The going was good and I just needed to avoid the debris from wheels that had blown out and bits of old snow chain that littered the sides of the freeway.</p>
				
				<p>I stopped at Subway near the Unionville services and was served by the genuinely friendly Britney. Before this trip I'd only ever visited bits of southern california and I wasn't keen on the tendency for fake friendliness behind fixed smiles with people asking you how you are and immediately walking off before you respond. Here however, Britney was generally interested and up for a conversation. She said she love to do this trip herself one day. Back in Half Moon Bay my friend Phil had given me three photography rules - get pictures of people I meet, of my bike and of me - so I dropped my normal British reserve and we took a selfie.</p>

				<p>As I got nearer to Winnemucca I was able to leave the freeway and use smaller roads. On the outskirts I sat in a McDonalds to get a big drink, use the toilet, and the free wifi to see where I was staying. I'd had a response from a Winnemucca-based WarmShowers host I'd contacted back in Reno so I was heading to him. At that point I had a call from Skylar from the day before who was checking I'd arrived safely. I had to apologise for not taking up his offer of staying with him given that someone else had said yes whilst I'd been out of internet contact. </p>
				
				<p>I found Henry, Lisa and family and they put me up in their amazing bunk house. We went out for dinner with their friends (where I ate a giant chicken salad) and then we went to a Chamber Music concert performed by a trio from a State university. It was excellent and incredibly cultured. I'd only met friendly, warm, people on my stay in Winnemucca. So much for the dire warnings.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0023.html">Emigrant Trail</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-02T20:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-02T20:00:00+PDT">Friday 02nd May 2014 (20:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I had a very late start today and headed to the <em>CowPoke Cafe</em> for brunch. It wasn't busy but by 11.30 am it started to fill up. I chatted to some people and it seemed Nevadans were unimpressed by my trip. They kept telling me I'd only just got started (I'd been on the road for 10 days) and they all knew someone who'd cycled across America. Perhaps they all knew the same person.</p>
				
				<p>I left Lovelock via the backroads which eventually turned into unpaved tracks. A brief stop at an I-80 underpass for some shade meant I disturbed a flock of small birds who obviously used it for nesting and were not keen on the idea of an upstart person on a bike sharing it. I apologised to them and joined the <em>Emigrant Trail</em>. It wasn't just a name, it was the actual trail the emigrants had used and you could still see the ruts from the wagon wheels. Here I was being a pioneer in the wild west (albeit going in entirely the wrong direction) if you ignored the I-80 several miles away to the east.</p>

				<p>I reached Rye Patch reservoir where there was a State park and a campground. I'm pretty sure I got undercharged for my camping as their "vehicle" prices didn't include the concept of a bicycle so I wasn't charged for it. I pitched my little tent and went for a walk. As I stood admiring the view, a young guy in a car pulled up and asked if I could fish. Obviously a standard greeting around these parts. His name was Skylar and he turned out to be really friendly. He insisted that he show me how to fish with a rod. Although the fish were literally jumping out of the water at us, we didn't get a bite. They were obviously taunting the tourist. We even went into the water to try catching them by hand but no luck there either. Skylar was ex-military and had served in Afghanistan. I got the feeling that going back to his civilian life was proving tough and that is a shame because he was really easy to get on with. He lived in Winnemucca and kindly offered me a place to stay there if I needed one. He left me with a warning about Winnemucca. He was now the third person to specifially warn me about Winnemucca on my trip and he was from it. What was this dangerous town I was heading towards?</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0022.html">Bad roads to Lovelock</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-01T23:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-01T23:00:00+PDT">Thursday 01st May 2014 (23:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>As I neared the I-80 again, I tried to see if there were any frontage roads. My <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a> maps showed little alternative but Google Maps claimed some roads. Trusting Google Maps out here turned out to be a big mistake. The "road" was nothing more than a rough sandy terrain that a 4x4 may have been over a couple of times. I just can't steer in more than a centimetre or so of sand. Two hours of pushing my bike under the hot desert sun wasn't much fun. The ridable parts were very bumpy and my IKEA top bag split. The extra bunjee cords from Oakland proved useful after all. At some point I also lost the battery pack for my solar panel making it utterly useless.</p>
				
				<p>Finally I found shelter from the sun in a tunnel under the I-80. I couldn't get on the freeway as it was protected by barbed wire. In my tunnel I enjoyed some mandarins (from Walmart in Fernley and that last I saw for thousands of miles) and pondered a plan of attack.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/14009651720"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14009651720_03c4546a76_c.jpg" alt="photo" title="I-80 underpass" /></a><figcaption>I-80 underpass</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I decided to try the other side of the freeway and that seemed promising until the rough "track" that included parts of old Lincoln Highway petered out into a barbed wire fence. Back I went to the tunnel and to the east side of the freeway. Within a mile a road suddenly emerged and the going improved. I spotted a car broken down at the side of the freeway so should over teh barbed wire fence to offer my help. The confused lady looked left and right trying to find the location of the voice. Eventually she turned around and did a double take. She probably didn't expect it to be someone on a bicycle in the desert. They didn't need my help so I pushed on the 18-20 miles to Lovelock.</p>
				
				<p>The Lazy-K campground lived up to its name as the office was permanently closed with a sign asking you to call a number. Over the phone I was told to fill in a registration card and deposit it with my money in a box. </p>
				
				<p>Although US railroads are mostly empty, it seems to be the law that trains (nearly always goods trains) must honk their horns long and loud as they approach civilization. They do this at all hours of the day and night. It doesn't make sleeping easy when you only have a tent wall to stop the sound. Together with the ever-present I-80, sleeping was difficult.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="0021.html">Loneliest highway and the 40-mile desert</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-01T14:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-01T14:00:00+PDT">Thursday 01st May 2014 (14:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>Following the previous day's uncertainty over freeways, I asked a traffic cop who I saw in a gas station how I should get to Lovelock. He said I couldn't go the direct way on the I-80 but would have to take the 50 then 95. This was another big triangular diversion. I was starting to think Nevada wanted me to visit all of it.</p>
				
				<p>The US50 is the "loneliest highway" and that sounded strangely attractive so I wasn't adverse to cycling a bit of it to Fallon. At Fallon I got another 40 oz drink. I'm not sure why anyone other than a thirsty cyclist needs that volume of liquid and sugar but it seemed to be popular with the drivers too. Fallon had a strip, and this being Nevada, it was lined with casinos. Actually, the gas stations all had rows of one-armed bandits in them too just in case you needed to gamble whilst filling your tank.</p>
				
				<p>A short distance north of Fallon, up the Nevada-95, takes you back into the desert. This is the 40-mile desert that Stevens mentions. In his day it was strewn with the decaying remains of animals who'd died pulling the wagon trains west. Now it was empty. </p>

				<p>The traffic dropped to a truck/SUV every few minutes. The road was straight, well-surfaced, and the riding was good. As the road drew closer to the railroad I tried riding on the salt flats but, the crisp surface was a thin layer with less solid stuff undernearth so it almost impossible to ride with a laden bike. Stevens must have pushed his penny farthing through this or walked on the railroad line.</p>
