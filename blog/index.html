				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-26T19:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-26T19:00+0100">Monday 26th Jun 2017 (18:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>This morning it wasn't raining. Hooray. I admired the view</p>

				<p>I made my way along the E6. It was flatter than it has been. I just had one big hill to contend with today. It was 260m or so. But first I went through Storslett which describes itself as a "National Park village". There I visited the Coop. My luxury item today was a 20 krone bottle of ketchup.</p>
				
				<p>My knees are feeling it now. I had the long slog up 260m. Thankfully my lowest gears are once again accessible after JÃ¸rn's service in Alta. At the top was a picnic spot that actually had a drinking water tap. I filled my bottles. Then I made fried egg sandwiches with the ketchup.</p>
				
				<p>Part way down the hill were some road works with the worst bit of temporary road I've experienced. Lots of loose, deep, gravel make steering hard which isn't fun when you have impatient traffic behind you.</p>
				
				<p>At the bottom I was on thankfully flat roads. Near Rotsund I met Kristina and J&ouml;rg, two Germans, who were from Buffalo, New York. It turns out they know the bike shop where I went on <a href="http://strudel.org.uk/RTWbike/blog/0094.html">the ice-cream ride</a>. We had a nice chat. They've cycled in lots of places and were currently heading up to Nordkapp.</p>

				<p>I was now heading to the ferry. Kristina and J&ouml;rg had told me it was free for bikes. On the way I had a detour to Slotett and got a great view from a bird hide. </p>

				<p>The going was good along the relative flat despite my knees. I reached the ferry and was reassured by a Norwegian, cycling with his son and son's friend, that it really was free.</p>

				<p>The ferry took me to Lyngeidet. I cycled about 10km and eventually found a spot to camp between the road and fjord. I had a pleasant cup of tea sat on a make-shift bench.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017013.html">Meeting people on the road</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-25T20:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-25T20:00+0100">Sunday 25th Jun 2017 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I was up and off earlier than normal. I rode along the fjord wishing my knees would feel less sore. I think my saddle had slipped down a few days ago so I'd shifted it up. Hopefully they'll improve. There is a worrying red mark near my right ankle that has been there a few days now. I assume something bit me. I hope it clears up.</p>
				
				<p>The village at the end of the fjord was closed as it was a Sunday so I couldn't get any water. I'd have to use mountain streams. I headed up the 260m hill rather slowly. Half way up I met two Germans cycling down. They'd cycled all the way from Siscilly! I carried onwards past signs warning about reindeer and elk/moose to the summit where there was a handy picnic table. I stopped for late breakfast. </p>

				<p>Whilst eating a couple of fried egg sandwiches, a Swiss man pulled up on his bike. He had a special trailer for his little dog, Barun. He'd cycled all the way from Switzerland. As we were chatting a camper van pulled up and I was greeted by a Scottish couple who'd spotted my Scottish flag as they drove by. They were Sheena and Alistair. They also had a lovely dog named Thistle. We all sat around the picnic table chatting. Sheena and Alistair made us cups of tea (with milk!) and gave us chocolate biscuits. There may not be anything as enjoyable as a nice cup of tea in a proper mug at the top of a hill after hundreds of kilometres cycling. Sheena also gave me a tin of baked beans! It turns out they've lived in the US and Alistair got to work near Cape Canavral so he told me about the rocket launches head seen. Sheena told some funny stories about bear encounters on treks in the US. It was lovely having a nice conversation and poor Christian could only follow bits of it due to the speed and accents. All good things come to an end so we got on our bikes and Sheena and Alistair waved us off in opposite directions.</p>

				<p>After a nice free wheel down to the fjord I met Mattieu who had cycled from Grenoble. He only spoke a little English so I practiced my French. He had two little stuffed animal mascots like the French guys from Alta. Perhaps it is a thing. As we were chatting I heard a friendly toot as Sheena and Alistair passed by.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDKm9HHWsAAJhRE?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Mattieu" /><figcaption>Mattieu</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>On another 8km around the fjord and the big hill for today started. It was a long, continuous, slog up 380m to the summit. There I met Celia from New Zealand who had a fold up bike with a suitcase on a special trailer she'd imported from the US.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDLhn3yXgAAQJJZ?format=jpg" alt="landscape" title="Celia" /><figcaption>Celia</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>As we parted the rain set in. But I had a nice long descent back down to fjord-level to enjoy. At Oksfjordhamn I decided I would start looking for somewhere to camp as I was getting tired. I went around the headland and found a little spot down from the road by the fjord. I put up my tent in the rain and huddled inside to eat dinner.</p>
				
				<p>It has been a great day thanks to meeting so many nice people. Special thanks to Sheena and Alistair for their hospitality and stories.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017012.html">Riding with Sander</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-24T21:00+0100" datetime="2017-06-24T21:00+0100">Saturday 24th Jun 2017 (20:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I had a late start. My feet were still sore from the walking yesterday. The blisters on my soles were still healing so walking was tough. My sister had got me a copy of my Norway map from my computer but it seems my GPS has bigger issues and still couldn't read it. Hmm.</p>
				
				<p>I visited the Coop on the way out of Alta. I splashed out on some carrots and dried plums. I was now about &pound;21 over budget. No campsites for me for a few days at least.</p>
				
				<p>The ride from Alta included some nice bike lanes and good views of the fjord.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="full"><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDFKpb3W0AE51K7?format=jpg"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDFKpb3W0AE51K7?format=jpg" alt="panorama" title="Alta fjord" /></a><figcaption>Alta fjord</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Arriving at the first tunnel I realised bikes weren't allowed. I had quite a long detour around the mountain. The second tunnel I could go through. The third I decided to cycle around on a little road that hugged the coast and was rewarded with some lovely views and got to be in the sunshine.</p>

				<p>I stopped at Tarvik for a late lunch. As I went to sit at a picnic bench, another cyclist turned up. He was called Sander and was from the Netherlands. He'd started at Nordkapp. We chatted and then road the rest of the afternoon together as far as Alteidet where he'd booked a cabin. I carried on a km or so and pitched my tent on the side of the fjord with a great view.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2017011.html">Limping to Alta</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-23T21:17+0100" datetime="2017-06-23T21:17+0100">Friday 23rd Jun 2017 (20:17 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I was up early. If I was to make the bike shop by midday I needed to be off. I left my woody camp amongst fragrant, short, plants at 8am. I was able to free wheel a bit but it got scary with only one set of juddering brakes. At the bottom I had to walk again. I could see Alta across the bay.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="full"><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDAEXBvWsAAD74G?format=jpg"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDAEXBvWsAAD74G?format=jpg" alt="panorama" title="Alta and fjord" /></a><figcaption>Alta and fjord</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I got frustrated aCnd worried on the walk. How much would it all cost? Would I have to use up my precious Norwegian currency that has to last to Bergen. Would I have to go a week without food and camping rough? I wanted the walk to end. A Frenchman on a bike stopped to see if I needed help. I was beyond the help of anyone else on the road themselves. A Dutchman in a van offered to give me, but not my bike, a lift to the bike shop. I couldn't see how that would help as it was my bike that needed to be there, not me. I kept walking.</p>
				
				<p>The bike shop had been suggested by Chris, a friend from Cardiff. During the night I'd been able to contact a local cyclist (who was away in Oslo) and he'd recommended the same one. I eventually reached Sport 1 at midday with very sore feet. After days of cold and wet I'd subjected them to walking in neoprene socks that chaffed my toes. But I was there.</p>
				
				<p>J&oslash;rn at the bike shop explained he had a full load on and had been working since 6am. However, he said he'd see if he could squeeze me in. I should leave my bike and come back in a few hours.</p>
				
				<p>I lugged my bags around the corner to a cafe in the nearby shopping centre. I treated myself to a hot chocolate and a small portion of fish and chips for 200 krones (about &pound;20). Norway is expensive. My daily budget is down to 150 krones so I'd overspent. I hadn't even paid for bike repairs yet.</p>
				
				<p>I snoozed on a bench in the sunshine with my solar panel out for the first time in days. Later in the afternoon I returned to the bike shop. J&oslash;rn had replaced the wheel.He didn't have the same valve as my front wheel unfortunately so I had to buy a spare inner tube to add to the other two spares I have. He gave my a discount on the wheel given my journey. Thank goodness for local bike shops. Make sure to support yours.</p>
				
				<p>I was able to pay with my UK bank card so felt less stressed. It can come out of the budget for the entire trip, not just the Norwegian part. By this point there were more staff in the shop and they told me where there was camping. I paid 180 krones for the night. I was way over budget but showers were included in the price so I could have my first in a week. </p>
