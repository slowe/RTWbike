				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-03T22:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-03T22:00:00+0200">Wednesday 03rd Jun 2015 (20:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>The youth hostel I was staying at was on the large 'island' created by a split in the Danube. It was actually a few miles from most of the main tourist sites and seemed largely to be be visited by large school groups. As I sat on the floor in the reception area - the only place the wifi was available - an angry looking man came through the door. He gave me an evil looking stare as he went by. The hostel was huge so I reasoned that the chances of him being in the same room as me were small. A little later when I got back to the room I was pleased to find it empty. However, a few minutes later, he turned up. He was my room mate and he'd had a bit to drink. It turned out he'd missed his last train or bus home from Vienna. Thankfully he wasn't a beligerant drunk but he still made me nervous. I kept my important possessions (money, passport, phone) very close throughout the night. In the morning he left and I stayed in bed for a while.</p>
				
				<p>I was in a major capital city full of sights but I really needed to do some laundry. The hostel, despite its size, didn't have any laundry facilities. They told me of a laundrette two miles away. Thankfully I had a bike so that wasn't a worry for me. I did my washing. It is nice to have fresh smelling clothes. I also visited the supermarket. I was really living it up in Vienna.</p>
				
				<p>On Tuesday, I decided to visit the Vienna Wanderers' Bicycle Club as Stevens had done. The problem is that they don't exist any more and neither does the street they were on; Schwimmschulenstrasse. <a href="https://twitter.com/Reesiepie/status/605425446864461825">Marie O'Sullivan on Twitter</a> managed to find out that it was near the station (<a href="http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=116717&imageview=true">grid reference F3 in an old map of Vienna</a>) only Schwimmschulenstrasse between 1873-1919. It was now Lassallestrasse. Even though the bicycle club didn't exist, I visited anyway and rode the length of the street. Afterwards I stumbled across an impromptu solar system scale model in the street near the station that was organised by the Zeiss Planetarium Wien. I then wandered over to the big wheel and had a ride through the large park. I then cycled over to the main part of the city and whiled away the afternoon snoozing in the pleasant Rathausplatz park near the Rathaus (town hall).</p>

				Wednesday was my last full day in Vienna so I went to the MuseumsQuartier to visit _mumok_ - the museum of modern art. It had everything from David Hockney (<a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606073606028853249">pleased to see him labelled as "Bradford, Yorkshire"</a>) to Yoko Ono to videos of naked bodies having paint thrown at them. Outside the MuseumsQuartier was a <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/606152094505177089">vegan festival</a> and I had a very nice vegan curry with lassi. As I left the festival I saw a young woman on a zebra-stripe bike adorned with roses. She told me it was some kind of pun as the German words for zebra and bike are similar.</p>

				<p>Packing up my tent I had to deal with ants crawling over all my stuff again. I wish we could come to a peace negotiation.</p>
				
				<p>I headed off along the pleasant <a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-6/countries/austria">EV6</a> into an impressive valley cut by the mighty river Danube. The EV6 goes along both banks at this point but I stuck to the south side reasoning that it would provide more shade for me and better lighting of the north for photographs. It was very pleasant and I stopped for breakfast at a little cafe where I was the only customer early on a Sunday morning. </p>

				<p>Enjoyable miles took me to Ybbs where there were lots of signs along the trail advertising a bicycle museum. Unfortunately for me, and the other cyclists who'd had their interest piqued, it was shut on a Sunday. If only I'd been a day earlier like Stevens.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19264993908"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/292/19264993908_483e4d4b5d_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Sign to the bicycle museum" /></a><figcaption>Sign to the bicycle museum</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>Onwards to Melk and the impressive monastery Stevens had mentioned. It certainly was big and still dominates the town. As I approached, I had to deal with clueless tourists pouring out of a Viking River Cruise boat into the cycle path. Then I got surrounded by a similarly unaware group of perhaps 20 touring cyclists all wearing matching green Lycra. In trying to get away from them I nearly came off my bike. In Melk I enquired at the tourist information about the oldest barbers to see if I could find where <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/000162.shtml">Thomas had a shave</a>. The lady in the tourist information office was confused by my request and told me they would be shut because it was Sunday. I said it didn't matter. I think she preferred the sort of questions from the cruise ship tourists.</p>

				<p>After a nice ice cream and a look around, with a heavy heart I left the flat and pretty EV6 to head across country. Unlike the previous diversions 'in-land' though this didn't look as hilly. That was true in parts. The cycle routes tended to follow the non-hypotenuse sides of triangles with the motorway taking the direct route. </p>

				<p>I reached Neulengbach where Thomas had stayed on the Saturday night. It didn't look to have much in the way of accommodation and a call to a youth hostel in Vienna indicated their reception was open 24 hours. I decided I'd press on and catch up. The only drawback was that Google Maps showed a huge hill. A well placed petrol station supplied me with juice as I'd exhausted all my liquid reserves. The hill was big but the downhill was glorious and long. It lasted about 15 miles to Vienna - several miles of which I stayed on the tail of a guy on a road bike much to his surprise and amusement.</p>
				
				<p>As I got into the city I found a river-side bike path for a few miles. In the city, lots of people were on bikes and there were plenty of bike lanes. I got freaked out by polite motorists giving way when bike lanes crossed roads. UK drivers wouldn't dream of doing that; at least not universally enough to trust that they would. The youth hostel was all the way across the city so it was getting dark as I arrived. I'd broken the Imperial century (100 miles), was exhausted, famished, but had at least caught up with Thomas. And he was giving me a few days off to recover!</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-30T21:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-30T21:00:00+0200">Saturday 30th May 2015 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I took full advantage of loading up my stomach at breakfast and got an earlyish start. The temperatures were getting hotter and it was blue skies. I was going to melt.</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/18547719328"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/267/18547719328_60440aa595_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Field of purple" /></a><figcaption>Field of purple</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>On the way out of Wels <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/604553102621044736">I randomly discovered Jupiter</a> which meant I was on another planet path. There was lots of nice bike trail that thankfully became wooded giving me some shade. Unfortunately the trail ended near Traun and my GPS decided the bike trails cut the corner off the bend of the river. Of course that meant hills. These weren't too bad and I even had some forest cover at some point. Down the other side to the Danube and I reunited with the Eurovelo 6. I decided to have a rest and a banana at one nice spot with a good view along the river. There was a bench but it was occupied by two other touring cyclists. I must have looked longingly at it because the lady asked if I wanted to sit down. She asked in English! The couple turned out to be Jane and John from Swansea who were cycling to Vienna along the Danube. They'd been in Blaubeuren and Ulm but had sensibly stuck with the river rather than strike a direct line over the hills as Stevens had. It was really nice to have a conversation and I ended up cycling with them to Wallsee. </p>

				<p>Unfortunately that meant I'd gone 3 miles beyond Strengberg so I had to head backwards. There followed a bit of cursing of Stevens as I realised Strengberg was up a big hill. Seriously Thomas, why not stay in the flat of the Danube valley?</p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19426435866"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/323/19426435866_aed7632ba5_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Strengberg" /></a><figcaption>Strengberg</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>The town was closed. Even the shop only did half day trading on a Saturday so it was back down the hill (couldn't get the full benefits due to a blind bend) and back up the other side to Well see. I decided to press on back to the EV6. Reaching Ardagger I saw one of the motorhome parks that they had in France - basically a bit of ground provided by the village with some electrical hook up points and a toilet block. This one had some grass though so being braver I asked a motorhomer if I could camp. They said "why not? give it a go" so I did. I boiled up some water and made tea and minestrone as the church bells rang out. The Morrison's Cafe milk sachets I've been carrying proved useful.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-29T21:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-05-29T21:00:00+0200">Friday 29th May 2015 (19:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>After leaving the Gasthaus I went to find toilet and discovered a huge car park, under kapellplatz, built in 1983. I left Altötting and headed for the Inn river trail again. It was nice to be on it so early and I cheerily said "hallo" to those on bikes going in the opposite direction. <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/604214617796136960">I passed through Marktl</a> where the last pope - the one who resigned - had been born. At Simbach am Inn I headed into the town centre to see what was there. Not a lot it turned out except for some free WiFi in the main square and I discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/604215009867079680">it was twinned with Skipton</a> in North Yorkshire. </p>
				
				<p><figure><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/18738235312"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/441/18738235312_b5beee2579_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="The bridge at Simbach am Inn over into Austria" /></a><figcaption>The bridge at Simbach am Inn over into Austria</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Time was moving on and so should I. It was time to cross the river into Austria. Unlike in Stevens's day there is no longer a border guard (yay for Shengen) and I didn't have to change my currency. I joined the Austrian version of the Inn river bike trail which started off quite rough but improved. As I left the environs of the Inn I spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/604242693812817920">an impressive tree house</a> complete with metal shutters on the window. At Altheim I stopped for lunch like Stevens but a day late due to my phone trouble. It was a nice outside beer garden in the main street and I chose it partly because a crew of elderly cyclists were dining there already.</p>
				
				<p>I left Altheim at 2pm already worried I'd been taking things too slow. Especially as Stevens wrote about an "aggravatingly hilly" road ahead. As he hardly noted the giant hill near Oppenau that had me worried.</p>
				
				<p>After a few days of relative flatness it did indeed get more hilly. This is mostly because Stevens kept a pretty direct line east rather than following the curve of the river. I got pretty exhausted just before Haag am Haustruck due to a big climb. It did result it a stunning view to the north and gave me a freewheel down into Haag which I managed to reach by 5pm. That still left me 24 hours behind. After loading up on drinks and sweets at the shop I decided to press on the extra miles to Lambach. </p>

				<p>In Lambach I realised it was another 10 or so miles to Wels where there was a youth hostel. There website and the Wels website didn't mention their reception hours so I rang up. They said they spoke "a little English" but that phrase was actually the extent of it so I still didn't know. I decided to push on following the Train river trail. I pushed hard despite still being exhausted from the hills. I arrived at 7.17pm to discover a sign on their door saying their hours were 5-7pm! Using the world's slowest 3G I spent an hour trying to find an alternative in the fading light. Eventually I had to give in and stay at the cheapest hotel I could find. Two days budget gone on one night. I took the opportunity to at least rinse my most smelly clothes from the day in the sink. For dinner I had to make do with bread and cheese left over from Munich washed down with Nutella.</p>
