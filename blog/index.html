				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015035.html">South along the Danube</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-09T01:30:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-09T01:30:00+0200">Monday 08th Jun 2015 (23:30 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>Before the trip I hadn't been able to plan a route between Budapest and Belgrade. That was partly because the Garmin software kept refusing to create routes between the places I wanted to go and also because I wasn't sure what to do. The EuroVelo 6 seemed to go down the east side of the river whereas all the places I needed to visit from Stevens's book were on the west side where the roads that seemed to be motorways were. I'd hoped that I'd be able to get some advice from locals when I was here. Unfortunately I hadn't met any locals who cycled and I've found over this trip that locals who don't ride bikes don't give good advice however well meaning they are. </p>
				
				<p>Tonight I was to stay with Patrick and his dad in Duna&uacute;jv&aacute;ros. We'd exchanged a few emails and he suggested I follow the EV6 and get a ferry across the Danube (or Duna as it is called in Hungary) at Adony. He offered to meet me there and as he had classes until 3 pm, I suggested I meet him at the 5 pm ferry. Not being able to create the route in my Garmin I was unsure exactly how far away Adony was but it didn't seem like a full day's ride so I decided to have a late start and take my time.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19265666098"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/520/19265666098_11dc18c9ee_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Buda from a bridge over the Danube" /></a><figcaption>Buda from a bridge over the Danube</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I crossed over the Danube to the Buda side of the river and back on the EV6. At Infopark it crossed the river again on the R&aacute;k&oacute;czi bridge and then took me through some industrial areas before bringing me back onto a large island at the billiantly named M0 road bridge.</p>
				
				<p>I was needing the toilet now and there was nowhere to go. I wasn't in the city but I wasn't exactly in the country either. The country-style road I was on seemed to be a one-street wide village that was lined with houses for miles providing little prospect of a secluded spot or of proper toilets. My dad would be the first to agree with me that the world needs more toilet facilities.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19265675378"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/501/19265675378_d750f76734_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="River-side houses" /></a><figcaption>River-side houses</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I was deliberately cycling slowly now because I was aware I was about half way to the ferry but still had hours until I was supposed to be there. So, after buying food and drink at a local supermarket I had lunch in a little bus shelter and then had a sleep on its bench as it was the only shade I could find. Unfortunately my sleep was interrupted by a surprisingly frequent bus service that kept stopping to see if I was getting on it. I'd hoped the laden bike would be a clue that I didn't. As the sun moved around it removed my shade so I decided to continue slowly onwards.</p>
				
				<p>I rode along a long road that had some kind of military base or prison on one side of it. All the side roads had signs demonstrating that you'd be shot if you went down them. I pressed on along a road with a monster tractor on it that I could have ridden under. I reached the ferry early so sat on the picnic benches nearby. A little after 5 pm I was on the ferry and back across the Danube. At the landing I met Patrick who was on a snazzy road bike and looked ready for a fast ride. I explained that I wouldn't be that fast. </p>

				<p>Patrick is a keen cyclist who regularly covers hundreds of kilometres a week. His brother had ridden from Istanbul through Russia to Mongolia so cycling was in the family. It was nice to be riding with someone today especially as Stevens had ridden from Budapest with Mr Igali. Back at Patrick's house in Duna&uacute;jv&aacute;ros he showed me various kit for his bike and his self-built, ultra quiet, computer. He showed me a powerpoint presentation he'd made for his English class so I corrected the (few) grammar mistakes for him. We had dinner and I got to meet his dad after he returned home from work. His dad didn't really speak English but was very friendly and welcoming. You could tell he really loved his sons and didn't seem to mind that his son was letting strangers stay with them. He jokingly referred to me as "The English Patient". As a thank you for the hospitality, I presented Patrick's dad with the bottle of wine I've been carrying with me from the Renchtal tourist office in Oberkirch.</p>
				
				<p>Patrick is a great young man who speaks excellent English and is very enthusiastic about the things that interest him. After dinner we stayed up talking until the small hours when I had to really insist that we got some sleep as he had school in the morning.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015034.html">Budapest</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-07T20:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-07T20:00:00+0200">Sunday 07th Jun 2015 (18:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>In Budapest <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/000169.shtml#blog">Thomas Stevens visited the National Exhibition of 1885</a>. I'd seen a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/FileC3%A1dler_National_Exhibition_in_Budapest_in_1885.jpg">painting by R&oacute;ber N&aacute;dler of the exhibition</a> and wanted to find it. I biked over to Heroe's Square where I found a tourist office. The tourist office said the building looked a bit like one of the train stations but then did some sleuthing online (they had an advantage over me as they could read Hungarian). It turned out that the building had been damaged during World War II and was subsequently destroyed. Even without the building I was still able to walk around the park area, sit under the trees and wander around a food festival (although I couldn't get food as it looked like you needed a Mastercard).</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19265591668"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/352/19265591668_9163a70da4_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Heroe's Square" /></a><figcaption>Heroe's Square</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Feeling hungry, I headed back towards the centre of the city. On the way I found an all-you-can-eat Hungarian bistro. The lady at the front seemed as though she couldn't care less about my custom. When I asked what it consisted of she said "Hungarian food" and pointed to the back of the room. I had a look and thought it looked OK but wasn't sure what to do. Do I wait to be seated? Do I just pick up a plate and help myself?</p>
				
				<p>I must have looked lost because a Colombian man came to my rescue explaining the system to me in Spanish. I don't know Spanish but my French and Italian gave me the gist. I was to go an help myself to as much as I wanted within two hours. Thanks to the anonymous Colombian man for his help.</p>
				
				<p>The food consisted of roast potatoes, boiled vegetables, rice, pasta, chicken wings, soups, sauces etc. I stocked up. There was a grill area but that looked as if it might be extra so, for simplicity, I ignored it. </p>
				
				<p>Of all countries I've visited on this ride, Hungary seems to have the most normal people on bikes. The bike paths are like the UK - bitty with parts that look like they suffered a bombing campaign after they were constructed. Despite that, there are plenty of families, elderly people, couples, teenagers out on their bikes in both the cities and villages. Very few have helmets. Riding a bike is normal and an acceptable way to get around.</p>
				
				<p>I rode down to the Danube, admiring the parliament building on my side of the river and the amazing, gothic, structures on the opposite bank. I crossed the big, angled bridge and joined thousands of others enjoying the Sunday atmosphere on the island of Margit-sziget where I mostly lazed away under the shade-trees.</p>
				
				<p>Later I headed back into the centre and suddenly found a section of the city notabale for the number of American accents. I assumed this meant I'd found the most touristy spot. I had an expensive lavender icecream.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><a href="2015033.html">To Budapest</a></h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-06T23:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-06T23:00:00+0200">Saturday 06th Jun 2015 (21:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I awoke to the sounds of footsteps on the pebble beach outside my tent. It was 5.15 am. Who was it? Was a knife going to slice through the thin, green, material into me? Was it a wild animal? I tried to think more clearly and decided it best to poke my head out of the flap. I looked around. A man was setting up a chair and his fishing kit. He didn't say anything and just continued setting up. I realised I'd probably taken his usual fishing spot and the beach wasn't really big enough for the two of us. I packed up my things and loaded up my bike. I'd been wanting to have a morning swim but I decided that I shouldn't as it would scare the fish away.</p>
				
				<p>With the Sun rising, I pushed out of my camp at 5.45 am for <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/607227224270487553">the earliest start I've had on the trip</a>. Back up on the path I found the fisherman's Lada and then lost the path. It just sort of stopped next to some more fishermen. I tried going along a hint of a path but that became a dead end. This certainly wasn't the EV6. After a bit of back-tracking I found where it had gone and was back on the right road. I arrived at Neszm&eacute;ly - Thomas Stevens' stop the night before - at 6.30 am to find that the first shop was open and already had a customer. I stocked up on food and drink. As I went through the village I found more little shops and then a SPAR. It was hardly 7 am and it was packed. People definitely got an early start to their day in Hungary. Amongst the other things on offer in SPAR I found Monty Python and Sherlock DVDs. I stocked up some more.</p>
				
				<p>After Nyerges&uacute;jfalu, I stopped on the side of a bike path to gorge on breakfast made of all the food I'd bought at three shops. I must have been a weird site to the people of all ages that cycled past me.</p>
				
				<p>By lunchtime, following the curves of the Danube, I reached Esztergom - the catholic capital of Hungary. Up on the hill, with tremendous views across into Slovakia and along the Danube in both directions, stood a huge cathedral. In the little ticket office I had the option to buy tickets to various parts. Following Strasbourg and Ulm, I opted for a trip up to the top of the dome. The ticket seller warned me that it was a long way up. I said I should probably be able to manage. At the top the <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/607228413519216640">views were stunning</a>. </p>

				<p>After the visit to the cathedral I dropped back down to the river and the EV6. After Esztergom the river bends back around to the east to head between some hills. Here there are some beaches and the locals were making the most of them. I found one unoccupied so occupied it and had my lunch. As I finished up, I was passed by a touring tandem and a minute or so later by a couple of other touring cyclists. I followed them the next few miles up to a point that I had thought was a bridge to Szob but turned out to be a ferry. As we waited for the ferry I got talking to them. The tandem was named "Big Purple" and was ridden by Heather and Richard who were from north Wales. Also waiting for the ferry were <a href="https://twitter.com/RTWbike/status/607230198812176384">a couple of German cyclists</a> and Richard and Andre from Strasbourg. I rode with Heather and Richard for a bit but parted ways as they went off to find a late lunch. On the ferry they had said that we were heading to Slovakia. I worried that I had no Euros but that was premature as it turned out the border had moved north just before Szob and we were still in Hungary.</p>

				<p>I carried along following the northern bank of the Danube to V&aacute;c passing canoes floating down the river and plenty of other cyclists on the bike route. Hungary is proving itself to be a bike-riding nation. On the other side of the river there was a castle or big house up on a hill with a grand prospect.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19427015536"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/510/19427015536_a755df478a_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Canoe" /></a><figcaption>Canoe</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>At V&aacute;c I had a while to wait for the ferry and joined Richard and Andre - the French cyclists - for a drink at a nearby cafe. When the ferry arrived we parted ways only to find ourselves meeting up again a few miles down the road. We cycled together for a few miles to Szentendre before parting ways again. </p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/18830645244"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/456/18830645244_ddc19fc5e8_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Richard and Andre" /></a><figcaption>Richard and Andre</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>I then headed along a bike route of various quality - sometimes great and sometimes awful - into Budapest. Coming into Budapest I met my first aggressively beeping driver of the trip. He wanted me to be in the cycle lane. So did I but the big fence between me and it meant I couldn't. As was becoming familiar on this trip, road and building works had removed cycle paths in places or re-routed them in ways that were difficult to follow for a visitor. Still, I got into Budapest and found free wifi at a Shell petrol station. Someone had told me that petrol stations were a reliable place to get wifi in this part of Europe. </p>
				
				<p>Online I found a youth hostel on the other side of the river so headed across. Although it was upstairs on the first floor, Adam the guy on duty was very friendly and helpful so let me bring my bike upstairs. It was the first hostel since the UK that had a kitchen I could actually make use of so I cooked dinner and made a cup of tea. It was a good, international, hostel with guests from Hungary, Mexico, Thailand, the Phillipines and Scotland. The Scottish guy had arrived back at the hostel but had lost his phone. I spent the rest of the evening helping him cancel his phone, contact people back in the UK and sort out his insurance. He also had to reset a lot of his online passwords.</p>

				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-05T22:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-05T22:00:00+0200">Friday 05th Jun 2015 (20:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>In the morning I packed up my tent and headed east out of Mosonmagyar&oacute;v&aacute;r to Hal&aacute;zi then through a series of small villages past long-horned cattle that Stevens had remarked upon and a small Jewish cemetary which had particular significance after my visit to Dachau in Germany.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/18830331844"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/300/18830331844_a4dea1ea94_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Jewish cemetary" /></a><figcaption>Jewish cemetary</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>I reached the lovely Gy&#337;r near lunchtime and, as I crossed the river, spotted an old Mississippi-style paddle steamer.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19265285958"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/19265285958_451bee8f18_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="River at Gy&#337;r" /></a><figcaption>River at Gy&#337;r</figcaption></figure></p>
				
				<p>Over into the main square I had a rest and then had a man come up to me, present me with a map of the town and then walk off. I found the tourist information office and obtained both a sticker and a local map showing cycle routes. I then found a McDonalds to use the toilet but found there was a little lady who made you pay. As I left the toilet I saw a lady had a dress fully tucked into her knickers. I tried to quietly say something to her but as I was speaking English she ignored me and walked off into the street unawares.</p>
				
				<p><figure class="landscape"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/19457136241"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/268/19457136241_478054568b_z_d.jpg" alt="photo" title="Main square of Gy&#337;r" /></a><figcaption>Main square of Gy&#337;r</figcaption></figure></p>

				<p>I decided to follow the "official" bike map as it showed a route to G&ouml;ny&#369; that avoided the motorway. Unfortunately, it took me along the 1 which then preceded to have lots of signs along it saying no bikes! This was the town's advertised cycle route and you can't cycle on it. I started to think that Hungary wasn't very joined up. Having no alternative road other than the motorway, I ignored the signs and pressed on. I had to keep ignoring them until somewhere near &Aacute;cs. </p>
				
				<p>After Kom&aacute;rom the route seemed to go off the 1, closer to the river. This took me along a dyke wall and into a wood where the path turned into a, well, footpath. I spotted a lovely little secluded beach just off the path. I was just under five miles from Neszm&eacute;ly - Stevens' destination for tonight - and I decided, as I didn't know if there would be camping ahead, to camp here for tonight.</p>
				
				<p>I pitched my tent on the pebble beach, had a quick swim in the Danube, cooked some food, and admired the glorius sunset from my little spot. I wasn't entirely alone - I could hear occasional sounds from the far side of the river in Slovakia - but it still felt exciting. I was also without internet as my sim card decided it wouldn't let me have roaming in Hungary. In the evening I heard two teenage lads making their way down to my little beach from the path but when they saw my tent they went somewhere else. As the stars came out I watched the lights of the river cruise boats making their way up and down the river. It was as close to perfect as I could get.</p>
