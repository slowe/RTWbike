I was sad to leave S&eacute;zanne on a sunny Sunday morning but I had to push on. The day was one of long straight roads. I'd been starting to doubt Stevens's miles, thinking he may have cheated by using the train, but his description of the roads and rolling hills being like Iowa rang very true.

In Vitry-le-Fran&ccedil;ois I stopped for a rest in the central square and washed my head in the fountain. I visited another fast food place with golden arches for their WiFi then pushed on into more wooded and hilly country. I started to see families out on their bikes enjoying the lazy afternoon sun.

Near Bar-le-duc I met the Marne and Rhine canal which took me, more or less, to the municipal campsite at the ch&acirc;teau. The steward was friendly even though we both knew about the same limited amount of our respective languages. He apologised for the amount of paperwork they have in France. I decided to stay two nights to have a rest and see the sights. There were three cycle tourers on the site that night.

On Monday morning I followed the English map and guide given to me by the steward to do my own walking tour. Amongst the sites of the old town was a monument to the creators of the velocipede - the Michaux brothers. How pleasing to cross paths with them.
