I feel I've been at mile 17 today. I'm so tired. Tired of navigating. Tired of needing to sort things out. I had to have a nap for an hour. An old Portuguese lady was concerned, perhaps thinking I'd collapsed. Through hands signals I said I was just having a sleep.

So I lost an hour from sleeping. I lost time from having to take a convoluted route this afternoon. I didn't get where I'd planned to.

As I arrived in Peniche I saw two people with panniers consulting a map. They were Charlie and Rob from Australia. They'd started from Paris two and a half months ago following Eurovelo 3 to the coast near Bordeaux then striking through the mountains from Biarritz.
