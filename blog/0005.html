				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-04-21T00:38+PDT" datetime="2014-04-21T00:38+PDT">Monday 21st Apr 2014 (00:38 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>From my time as an astronomer I've got to know people who are spread all over the world. One fried, Phil Marshall, now lives near San Francisco in a place called Half Moon Bay. He invited me to stay with him for a couple of days and organised for a few other astronomers/ex-astronomers I knew to meet up with us. So Dan FM, Amit, Eli, Phil and I enjoyed the afternoon sunshine, walked to the beach, had a pint and food in the local pub. Eli suggested I needed an app to report if I was eaten by a bear or cougar! It was great to spend some time with friends even if I was called a "hipster cyclist" for recreating a 19th Century trip. </p>
				
				<p>Before I left Half Moon Bay, Phil and I had a quick trip to the ocean so that I could dip my wheel in the Pacific as is traditional on coast-to-coast trips. This wasn't really my starting point but I knew I'd have a hard time doing it back in the city. </p>
				
				<p>Huge thanks to Eli, Amit, Dan FM and particularly Phil for being my welcome party to the US. They helped settle the nerves in advance of what is to come.</p>
