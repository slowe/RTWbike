I left the campsite on top of the hill in Jagodina (J&#1072;&#1075;&#1086;&#1076;&#1080;&#1085;&#1072;) and headed down the other side. Not before getting a view of Jagodina itself.

In nearby &Cacute;uprija (&#1035;&#1091;&#1087;&#1088;&#1080;&#1112;&#1072;) I stopped in a sports bar for a toilet trip followed by a drink because I felt guilty just using the facilities. In the main square there was a nice finger post showing where I've been and where I'm going.

It was a lovely sunny day and I was starting to head up into the famous Balkan mountains. After the relative flat of the Danube since Austria, I knew the Balkan Mountains were my next (and last) major hills to get over. I wasn't really sure how steep they'd be. They couldn't be any worse than what I've been over on this trip.

Off to the distance in the east was an amazingly conical mountain which made me think of Mt Fuji or mountains that kids would draw. It was very distinctive.

I was now heading up the Morava valley but on a local road that wound its way from side to side of the major motorway that continues on towards Bulgaria and Turkey. After a drink stop in the same town where Stevens had lunch, I headed out of town a couple of miles following the edge of the hill. I decided to stop for lunch at a high bend that commanded a stunning view of the Morava valley. Weirdly, the blue skies, flat farmland, big highway, and distant mountains reminded me of [California between Fairfield and Davis](http://www.strudel.org.uk/RTWbike/blog/0008.html).

The riding was fairly pleasant as most of the traffic was on the motorway. I arrived into Ni&scaron; (&#1053;&#1080;&#1096;) an hour ahead of Stevens.
