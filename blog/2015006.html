				<h2 class="title">Through the Chilterns to Watford</h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-05-06T19:00:00+0100" datetime="2015-05-06T19:00:00+0100">Wednesday 06th May 2015 (18:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I alternated between main road and canal towpath this morning. On the main road I had large, high-sided trucks overtaking at 60 mph leaving minimal space. They blocked the wind sucking me towards them. After they passed I got buffeted by the wind again after. The towpath was slower but far safer and prettier. It also meant I could admire the wildlife.</p>

				<p>As the route swung around to the south, the side wind of the past couple of days turned into a bit of a head wind. I paused in Berkhampstead for pie and mash (not just any pie and mash - M&S pie and mash). There was a Penny Farthing hotel but it was over £115 a night! It seemed all the local accommodation was over £100 or fully booked. Onwards. I crossed the M25 - London's orbital motorway - and headed south to Watford.</p>

				<p>Over the phone I negotiated a £30 room in a B&B. In trying to find it, a big, blue, nox caught my attention. There was a TARDIS in someone's front garden. Next to it was a velociraptor and a robot dog! </p>

				<p>As I stopped to take a picture the owner jumped out and said he'd move his car for me. His name was "Ska-V-Goldsmith" (or Nigel) and he seemed to be a modern day polymath with claims of a background in nuclear fission, rocket science and art. Nigel was certainly a very interesting person.</p>
				
				<p>At the B&B I was greeted by Julien who was originally from the Congo and was a fan of <a href="http://justgiving.com/rtwbike">MSF</a>. He helped me get my bike into the back yard.</p>
