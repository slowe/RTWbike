The campsite in Westport wants &euro;27 to pitch a one person tent! No way.

The hostel is &euro;22.50!

If only the wind hadn't been against me I would have got to the hostel with &euro;12 camping. :(

So, it turned out I could book a smaller dorm room in the hostel online for &euro;18. Saving &euro;4.50 on the price the person in the reception said.

Feels a bit awkward to book online at the reception but that money can go on food. Plus I get a (hopefully) quieter dorm.

It also turns out the campsite website had told me the wrong price. It should have been &euro;12.
