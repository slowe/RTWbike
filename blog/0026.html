				<h2 class="title">A rest day</h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2014-05-05T18:00:00+PDT" datetime="2014-05-05T18:00:00+PDT">Monday 05th May 2014 (18:00 PDT)</time></div>
				<p>I had started to get a head cold during the night. As I'm ahead of Stevens, I decided to have a rest day. I spent it mostly in bed with medication, tea and bits of American TV. I felt very lazy.</p>
				
				<p>I was aware of Battle Mountain before I arrived. Being on a large, flat, plain, it is the location of the human-powered land speed record. In 2009 Canadian Sam Whittingham had come here and set the record at an incredible 82.8 mph. A few months before my trip, Sebastiaan Bowier from the Netherlands had been here and managed to get to 83.13 mph. I bet they didn't have panniers on their bikes.</p>
