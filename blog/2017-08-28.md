I have reached Cork.

Found the discounted-because-going-out-of-date section at SuperValu today. Yes!

I ate an entire, heavily discounted, 500g banoffee pie in a petrol station forecourt (sheltering to avoid the rain).

Being a big city, there doesn't seem to be much camping. However, I found a â‚¬16 hostel so I can have a bed and be dry for once.
