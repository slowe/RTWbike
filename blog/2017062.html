				<h2 class="title">A big ride</h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-08-12T23:59+0100" datetime="2017-08-12T23:59+0100">Saturday 12th Aug 2017 (22:59 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>It rained all night so i gave up on reaching the Fallcaragh parkrun. Best laid plans and all that. It had tipped it down all night. I didn't fancy putting all my damp stuff away in the rain so I waited. Laying in my tent at about 8.30 I heard the boy from the night before saying "why hasn't that man gone yet?". Because it has been raining rude little man.</p>
				
				<p>The family headed off somewhere when the rain stopped. I then took my tent down and headed off in the clothes I'd been sleeping in as they were dry.</p>
				
				<p>It hadn't been a friendly start to the day but the weather improved and the sun came out. I saw the first signs for Eurovelo 1 perhaps since Norway.</p>

				<p>I had lunch at a picnic spot just after Dunfanaghy. I ate a whole carrot cake. I didn't reach Falcarragh until early afternoon so even if I'd had any earlier start I wouldn't have reached parkrun in time.</p>

				<p>After Falcarragh was the beautiful Inis B&oacute; Finne and Tory Island off out to sea. I slightly shortened the headland as I was now heading further than I'd planned today. I'd called a youth hostel in Glenties who had said their housekeeper had been ill. When I asked about camping they hung up. So I was headed for Carrick. I'd have to get a move on.</p>

				<p>The roads got flatter and more manageable. I found dedicated cycle lane but it turned into a bumpy gravel surface that cut my speed in half and shook my bike. So I went back to the smooth road.</p>

				<p>On the way to Ardara I met Martin and Michael who accompanied me for a few kilometres chatting. It was nice to have some company. We parted ways in Ardara where it was show day and they gave me onward directions.</p>

				<p>Out of Ardara I knew I had a climb ahead. Google maps had been able to warn me of it. It was Malaidh Ghleann Gheis; a steep, switchback, climb. As yesterday I kept going up it in my lowest gear and only stopped at the viewpoint near the top. There I met <a href="http://shellon2wheels.blogspot.ie/p/about-me.html?m=1">Michelle</a> who cycled from Vancouver to Panama last September. She was cycling around Donegal for a week. It turned out she'd also had a similar insight into Us politics that I'd had in 2014. We'd both predicted the outcome of the 2016 election. Perhaps more politicians and journalists should do cross continent bike trips.</p>

				<p>I said goodbye to Michelle and rode mostly downhill to the hostel. I was quite late but they were very friendly and, after pitching my tent, I made a big plate of pasta and ate most of a packet of digestives whilst admiring the stars above.</p>
