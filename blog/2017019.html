				<h2 class="title">Land of the flies </h2>
				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2017-06-30T20:30+0100 " datetime="2017-06-30T20:30+0100 ">Friday 30th Jun 2017 (19:30 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>I woke late. Sheena brought out some maps and we discussed routes and ferries. I packed up and said goodbye to my friends on the road and continued south.</p>
				
				<p>The weather was on the change. The beautiful sunshine of yesterday had given way to clouds that threatened rain. I cycled over the bridge at Risk&oslash;yhamn. I cycled around the inlet at Buksnasfjord and then had lunch on the beach on the Risk&oslash;ysundet channel where I think I saw a seal pop its head out of the water. This was one of the few spots I found were I could stop without being mobbed by flies.</p>

				<p>Getting anywhere in Norway involves more kilometres than it looks on a map thanks to the fractal coastline. I had another big fjord to go around at Forfjord.</p>

				<p>Eventually I got to and over the bridge to Sortland. Despite a rather pretty church, the centre of Sortland felt drab. It was 4pm on a Saturday and nearly all the shops were shut. The tourist information office had closed at 2pm. I'd been going to ask them about ferries to Bod&oslash;. At least the Coop was open.</p>

				<p>South of Sortland was more pleasant. There was a separate cycle/walking path which was flatter than the main road. I politely interrupted a Norwegian lady hanging out some washing to ask if she could fill my water bottles. I reached the bottom of Lang&oslash;ya and was up and over the 3km long, 35m high bridge to Stokmarknes. The bridges are so high so shipping can get through the channels.</p>
				
				<p>At Stokmarknes I had a choice of which side of the island to go around. I chose the west side as the map showed a swimmer symbol and that suggested a likely camping spot with a toilet. Unfortunately, as it turned out, I couldn't find a toilet. There was a nice view but as soon as I started putting up my tent the mob of flies were back. I got out my travel head net which solved the fly issue but made eating dinner a bit more of a challenge. </p>

				<p>I went to sleep on rather bumpy ground.</p>
