Lesley is cycling this bit of coast despite having had her leg broken by a horse back home.

She spotted my Yorkshire top and we had a chat outside the Intermarche. We then cycled together for a few miles.

She had read Anne Mustoe's books so we had a nice conversation about her as well as Lesley's cycle to Greece for the 2004 Olympics.

The 'river' is flowing backwards as the tide was coming in.

This part of France has quite an extent of forest bike lanes near the ocean. Over the past 250km I've rarely been on roads.

I have ridden on roads occasionally since Royan to either reduce the kilometres or because the bike path went more inland than I liked.

I've had to constantly ignore my GPS today as it likes to opt for longer routes. I'm doing a lot of manual route adjustment.

Despite the fact I'm cycling so close to the ocean, I've hardly seen it as the forest and dunes keep it hidden from sight.

I visited the SuperU to get some supplies. I got some Orangina and chocolate gauffres as this is probably my last night in France.

The municipal campsite office was closed despite this being one of my earliest finishes. They don't open again until 10am.

After a few days of flat riding in southern France, I'm expecting to be back to hilly ground in northern Spain. Progress will be slower.
