Day 77 and it's September. It may have to be an epic day today.

The hills wouldn't be so bad if I could get the benefit of them.

Current location is near Burry Port [](https://t.co/1CqTnSlR4L)

I've done 89 km of cycling so am stopping for a cup of tea. â˜•

Kudos to Swansea's West Pier Deli. They just asked me and some other cycling people what they could do to improve their provision for bikes.

Saturday was a rest day with friends in Cardiff. It was so great to spend the day with old friends.
