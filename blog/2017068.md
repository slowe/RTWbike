After 47 km in wind and driving rain, I still had well over 100 km to go. I was soaked through. It was not fun. 47 km was what the coast road turned out to be. The main road sign had said 9 km. I really wish I knew the __actual__ road distances between places along the Wild Atlantic Way.

In Clifden I stopped whilst the rain intensified. A lady in a local pub described it as a monsoon which sounded about right. A few miles further down the road I realised I had lost my glasses. Perhaps it was in Clifden when I'd taken them off because I couldn't see in all the rain. There was no point going back to find them.

So. Many. Bad. Tourist. Drivers. I'll be glad when I finally get off the Wild Atlantic Way.

I'm sick of being hassled on tiny, twisty, roads by people who are unsure. It was the same on the North Coast 500 in Scotland.

Having cycled thousands of kilometres on little coastal roads now, I perhaps have too much experience.

Huge thanks to the lovely man in the shop in Cil Chiar&aacute;in for the Apple tart and coffee.

179 km (111 miles)!

Slightly freaked out twice today to see colour beyond the purple on different rainbows. Must be octarine. ;) #magic

More seriously though, can the human eye see UV? My brain interpreted it as a greeny-yellow-ish colour.
