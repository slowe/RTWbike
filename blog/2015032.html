				<div class="posted">By Stuart Lowe on <time pubdate="2015-06-05T22:00:00+0200" datetime="2015-06-05T22:00:00+0200">Friday 05th Jun 2015 (20:00 UTC)</time></div>
				<p>In the morning I packed up my tent and headed east out of Mosonmagyar&oacute;v&aacute;r to Hal&aacute;zi then through a series of small villages past long-horned cattle that Stevens had remarked upon and a small Jewish cemetary which had particular significance after my visit to Dachau in Germany.</p>

				<p>I reached the lovely Gy&#337;r near lunchtime and, as I crossed the river, spotted an old Mississippi-style paddle steamer.</p>

				<p>Over into the main square I had a rest and then had a man come up to me, present me with a map of the town and then walk off. I found the tourist information office and obtained both a sticker and a local map showing cycle routes. I then found a McDonalds to use the toilet but found there was a little lady who made you pay. As I left the toilet I saw a lady had a dress fully tucked into her knickers. I tried to quietly say something to her but as I was speaking English she ignored me and walked off into the street unawares.</p>

				<p>I decided to follow the "official" bike map as it showed a route to G&ouml;ny&#369; that avoided the motorway. Unfortunately, it took me along the 1 which then preceded to have lots of signs along it saying no bikes! This was the town's advertised cycle route and you can't cycle on it. I started to think that Hungary wasn't very joined up. Having no alternative road other than the motorway, I ignored the signs and pressed on. I had to keep ignoring them until somewhere near &Aacute;cs. </p>
				
				<p>After Kom&aacute;rom the route seemed to go off the 1, closer to the river. This took me along a dyke wall and into a wood where the path turned into a, well, footpath. I spotted a lovely little secluded beach just off the path. I was just under five miles from Neszm&eacute;ly - Stevens' destination for tonight - and I decided, as I didn't know if there would be camping ahead, to camp here for tonight.</p>
				
				<p>I pitched my tent on the pebble beach, had a quick swim in the Danube, cooked some food, and admired the glorius sunset from my little spot. I wasn't entirely alone - I could hear occasional sounds from the far side of the river in Slovakia - but it still felt exciting. I was also without internet as my sim card decided it wouldn't let me have roaming in Hungary. In the evening I heard two teenage lads making their way down to my little beach from the path but when they saw my tent they went somewhere else. As the stars came out I watched the lights of the river cruise boats making their way up and down the river. It was as close to perfect as I could get.</p>
