I used to be frustrated by being given a large jug of milk with a pot of tea. Now I look forward to the free cup of milk at the end.

I have to be my own sports psychologist to keep the motivation going. This is day 84.

It turns out I also cycled to the Andes. Three Andrews to be exact. Tomorrow they start cycling to John O Groats.

Today I cycled through Skinner's Bottom. I've a feeling I may have that despite the padded shorts.

I did shed a couple of surprise tears on seeing the view. Partly the view, partly the weather, partly the achievement.

(It had been raining on and off all day and I was damp all through. The final rain shower got me 1.5 km from Land's End. Then sun.)

I had a few people at Land's End ask me if I was at the start or end of my ride. I think it is unusual to be part way through.
