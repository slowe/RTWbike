Wondering if I could pop to Greece for a coffee. It is only 3km away but not sure how long the border crossing is. I have no Euros either.

In Greece. The ATMs will not give out money due to the crisis as a nice Greek lady who spoke excellent English explained to me.

In Turkey. I think the ATM just charged me a big fee (on top of my bank). At least I have some money.

Thanks to Tess who I met in Serbia (having cycled from China), I have a Turkish sim card so have some 3G.

After being repeatedly warned that it was impossible to cycle into Istanbul without dying, I was glad to find [a website with advice for my route from Silivri into Istanbul](http://thenextchallenge.org/tips-for-cycling-into-istanbul/).

My first day in a new country means working out what the drivers are like, what roads I can cycle on, and how to get food and water again.

Went to sleep in my tent before 8pm.
