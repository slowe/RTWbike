				<p>I left from central Warrington at about 9.20 am and made my way out onto the Knutsford Road (45 casualties said the red sign).I reached Knutsford by 10.30 and was met by my friend Peter who had arrived by car to visit the Knutsford Penny Farthing Museum.</p>
				
				<p>The museum was hidden away in a courtyard and was run by a man who had cycled from San Francisco to Boston on a penny farthing 20 years ago. Unfortunately, he wasn't in today but we got to see their collection and had a hearty breakfast.</p>

				<p>At Knutsford I said goodbye to Peter and continued on over Cheshire lanes to Jodrell Bank home of the mighty Lovell Telescope. I'd spent a few years working there so I was on lanes I knew. I stopped at the new Visitor Centre to see it and have a nice, relaxing, cup of tea. With it being a Sunday none of the people I knew were around and some had retired but I had a good chat with Jill and Soliyta. Over tea I also got talking to two cyclists -Chris and Owen - who were organising a charity ride from Edinburgh to London in July.</p>
				
				<p>Heading on from Jodrell, out beyond the Red Lion at Swettenham, I stopped for a chat with David who was cycling to Sandbach.</p>

				<p>I pressed on beyond the area I knew to Congleton where I picked up the lovely Biddulph Valley Way cycle trail. It slowly ascended upwards along a wooded track but with occasional views of lambs lazing in the sunshine. The weather had been mixed this morning but had stayed dry this afternoon.</p>
				
				<p>Around Stoke-on-Trent I had some tricky points on National Cycle Network where the gates became impossible to get through with panniers and a very steep hill. In the middle of Stoke-on-Trent there was some confusing routing but I managed to hit the canal trail along to Stone where I was staying with the wonderful Taylors. Gordon had ridden across America, bits of Canada, and lots of Europe so was a wealth of stories and information. They were excellent hosts and made a great fish pie for dinner.</p>
