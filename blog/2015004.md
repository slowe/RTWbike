After an attempted ride on Gordon's tricycle, in which I couldn't steer and headed for a ditch, I set off south to Stafford. South some more took me under the M6 and on the hunt for a toilet. This is surprisingly difficult on a Bank Holiday Monday as nowhere is open. After asking lots of clueless locals, I eventually found one in Bloxwich where I also stopped for a late lunch. Getting into big cities is slow going so I was glad to find a canal trail that took me to the site of the old tricycle works which long ago closed down. I stopped briefly for a picture at the fantastic library building.

My right knee had started hurting yesterday and it was making it difficult to get up the little steep bridges on the towpath.

Out of Birmingham I was on main road which wasn't to bad. Over the border into Warwickshire the roads became more rural and I stopped at Allesley, on the outskirts of Coventry, for the night
