It rained on and off through the night. What luxury to wake up with sunshine though?

The lady running the campsite says the weather is more like winter. It's better than I've had though so I'll take it.

Clearly the sunshine has been joined by rain showers but I got to put away a dry tent before that.

Having a really nice cream tea at Britain's second most southerly cafe (25m up from the other one) as the queue was shorter.

Gill and Stuart from York who I talked to at Pendower beach (just after I'd talked to a couple from Ripon) whilst navigating a road closure.

The road was gone thanks to coastal erosion.
