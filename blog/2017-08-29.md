Stopped to say hi to someone with panniers. It only turned out to be Martin, the German cyclist I met at the ferry to Lofoten in Norway.

Martin cycled down to Denmark, through Germany, France, England, and Wales then over to Dublin.

It has been two months since we last met on the road.

This is not a drill. I can see sunshine and some blue sky. I have a shadow again.

Staying in Tramore at my friend Cormac's mum's house.
