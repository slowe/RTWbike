In the morning I left the hostel and set off to find the Hagia Sofia. My first knowledge of it was as a wonder of the world in the computer game Civilization, and I'd been looking forward to finally seeing it in person.

In the tourist area I had two Brits and then a nice lady from Melbourne ask me if I was from Yorkshire; it was written in big letters on my top. I took the opportunity to visit one of the tourist gift shops near the Blue Mosque to find a sticker for my bike. Through Serbia and Bulgaria it had been extremely difficult to find stickers but here I managed to find an entire sheet thanks to the shop keeper even if he was confused as to why I wanted to put them on my bike. As I was adding the stickers, the lady from Melbourne came back over to talk to me and then some Italians wanted their picture with me. I was becoming a tourist attraction in my own right.

I pushed my bike over towards the Hagia Sofia. I wasn't in a rush. I'd originally set out to cross the US and had extended that to follow Stevens across Europe. I was finally here. I had cycled aross two continents and, as someone on Twitter pointed out, an entire religion. I had a content smile on my face. It has been fun following you Thomas. Enjoy the rest of your ride to Japan (in 1885-6). This is where my journey ends.

Thanks to everyone who has followed me across two continents and for the many tweets of encouragement along the way. Thanks also to everyone who donated to Medicins Sans Frontiers.
