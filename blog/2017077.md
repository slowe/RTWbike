I put on my wet clothes. I put away my wet tent. I put on my wet waterproofs. I headed out into the rain and mist.

Things I've heard lots in the past 70 days:

> The weather isn't usually as bad as this.

> This is Norway/Scotland/Ireland, of course you should expect rain.

> You should have been here in May/June/July.

> It is our worst June/July/August in 23 years.

> It is supposed to get better in the next few days.

It hasn't got better.

I got a little round of applause from a couple in a campervan when I reached the top of a climb.

On this last peninsula to Mizen Head, the northern coast road was great. Really quiet. A few walkers and runners out.

Well, the most southerly point in mainland Europe isn't going to cycle to itself. Onwards.

Turns out Mizen Head isn't the most southerly point. So I've just been there. Missed Yoda though.
