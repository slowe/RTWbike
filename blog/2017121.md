I was riding along quite happily when my GPS launched itself out of its holder and into the thorny undergrowth by the side of the road. Five minutes were lost locating it and then trying to fish it out with minimal blood loss from the thorny scratches. A few minutes later a big dog came bounding towards me from a shack. I slowed and got off my bike. That stopped its advance. The owners seemed to be shouting something at me from within the shack. My guess is that it was the classic "it won't hurt you". I never believe that. I cleared the area on foot then sped off.

I reached Lagos (not the one in Africa) a whole hour before sunset. Such luxury! It was just as well as I got the last bed in the youth hostel. I am sharing my dormitory with a Dutchman and a French couple. My high school French has been in more use than I'd expected outside of France.

For once I went and ate out; I found a little chicken shop. I then wandered the evening streets of Lagos like a regular tourist. It was funny to hear British accents.
