It is frustrating when a campsite charges me the same amount as two people in a motorhome or caravan. I use fewer resources and less space. I also had to wait until 10am for the reception to open and then the 15 minutes of French paperwork.

I crossed my second land border of the trip. This one had a sign marking the occasion. I crossed the bridge into Spain.

After a few days of flatness, I suddenly had to climb a 455m hill. Spain is giving me a taster of the next few days.

Having trouble finding campsites so I had to go for a hostel. That used up all of today's budget and some of tomorrow's.
