Bought fruit from the busy market in Pazardjik just like Stevens. The lady at the stall threw in a bonus nectarine.
There's a strong wind today. Thankfully from the west

Decided to have a short day and stay in Plovdiv as it seems a shame not to see the sites. I'll have a long day tomorrow instead.

Plovdiv is very nice. Roman ruins. Galleries. Street cafes. Nice gelateria too.

It was followed by an icecream sundae but that didn't last long enough for a photo. Yum.

Met LN and Matthew, from Ohio, on a walking tour and then spent the evening chatting over dinner.
