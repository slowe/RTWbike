Around the world on a bicycle 2014
=======

The first round-the-world bicycle ride was [by 29 year old Thomas Stevens](http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/stevens/about.shtml) using an "Ordinary" or "Penny Farthing". He set off set off from San Francisco in April 1884. The aim would be to recreate [that journey](https://github.com/slowe/RTWbike/blob/master/stevens1884.geojson) as closely as is possible on the 130th anniversary.
